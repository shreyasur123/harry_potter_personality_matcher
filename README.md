# harry_potter_personality_matcher
This is a t-sne implementation on hp dataset.

The Harry Potter dataset is taken from kaggle and has copyright of Louis Chauvet.

I combined dialogues and characters dataset to make a new dataset which I then used to create a personality matcher. 

I used Bag of Words to convert the dialogues into numeric values and I chose the top 2500 words in the dialogues. 

I used t-sne for dimensionality reduction and plotly to plot the graph.
