Aberforth Dumbledore,"in here, potter. you bloody fools! what were you thinking coming here? do you have any idea how dangerous it is -- where've you left him? sorry to hear it. i liked that elf. mundungus fletcher, 'bout a year ago. sirius. albus told me. he also told me that you'd likely be hacked off if you ever found out i had it. but ask yourself where you'd be if i didn't. right then. reckon you're hungry. let's get you fed, then think of the best way to get you out of here. the order is finished. you-know- who's won. anyone who says otherwise is kidding themselves. did he now? nice job? easy? it's not a job my brother's given you, it's a suicide mission. do yourself a favor boy. go home. live a little longer. keep secrets? you tell me. did you now? and why is that? that's a boy's answer. a boy who goes chasing horcruxes on the word of a man who won't even tell him where to start. you're lying. not just to me, which doesn't matter, but to yourself as well. that's what a fool does. you don't strike me as a fool, mr. potter. so i'll ask you again. there must be a reason. why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? why? you know what to do... you'll see soon enough. she'll always be beautiful. my brother sacrificed many things, mr. potter, in his journey to find power, including her. she was devoted to him -- he gave her everything, but time.",261
Alastor Moody,"yeah, he's ruddy gorgeous.  what say we get undercover before someone murders him. all right, all right!  you'll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!  we've got to get the hell out of here and soon! potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the trace on you. you sneeze and the ministry will know who wipes your nose.  point is, we have to use those means of transport the trace can't detect: brooms, thestrals and the like. we'll go in pairs.  that way if anyone's out there waiting for us -- and i reckon there will be -- they won't know which harry potter is the real one. i believe you're familiar with this particular brew. everyone here's of age, potter, and they've all agreed to take the risk. nip it, mundungus!  all right, granger, as discussed. straight in here, if you please. for those of you who haven't taken polyjuice potion before, fair warning.  it tastes like goblin piss. not yet you aren't. fancy this:  you're not you, so shut it and strip. you'll need to change too, potter. blimey.  i almost forgot. right then.  we'll be pairing off. each potter will have a protector. as for you, harry... the real harry!  where the devil are you, anyway? you'll ride with hagrid. yeah, it's all very touching. let's go. severus snape? good luck, everyone.  on the count of three.  one... two -- quiet, dursley. we're not talking about it here, it's too risky. blast it. i want 365 degree visibility on the return trip. right, let's go. form up! form up around harry. make it snappy! the advanced guard surrounds harry. we must be ready. this would be the perfect moment for voldemort to strike harry. mount your brooms, everyone. here we go! the third signal, everyone. let's stay in formation! we need more height! contacts to the south! come on, potter! keep moving! potter, getting yourself killed won't do a thing. now move! we're not far, now! did you get rid of them? prepare for descent! form up around harry! right, harry, this way. here, read this. come on, inside. hurry. that stupid roof. i can do that. excuse me gentlemen, it may interest you to know that this conversation is no longer private. put that in your mouth. bartimus! not trying to lure potter into one of the ministry's summer internships are we? last boy who went into the department of ministries never came out! and they say i'm mad. the hell he is. the goblet of fire is an exceptionally powerful magical object, only an exceptionally powerful conjurer could have hoodwinked it. magic way beyond the talents of a fourth year. it was once my job to think as dark wizards do karkaroff perhaps you remember? yeah took a piece of me with him though didn't he. champions! prepare yourselves. are you alright potter? does it hurt? i'd better take a look at it. what was it like? what was he like? the dark lord. what was it like to stand in his presence? were there others? in the graveyard, were there others? marvellous creatures dragons aren't they? do you think that miserable oaf would have led you into the woods if i hadn't suggested it? do you think cedric diggory would have told you to hold the egg under the water if i hadn't have told him first myself? do you think neville longbottom the witless wonder could have provided you with gilliweed if i hadn't have given him the book that led you straight to it? huh?? you won because i made it so potter. you ended up in that graveyard tonight because it was meant to be so. and now the deed is done. the blood that runs through these veins runs within the dark lord. imagine how he will reward me when he learns that i have once and for all silenced the great harry potter. albus dumbledore. no. i'm sorry albus. that's a foal glass. lets me keep an eye on my enemies. if i can see the whites of their eyes they're standing right behind me. wouldn't even bother telling you what's in ther. you wouldn't believe it if i did. now... what are you going to do about your dragon? sit. listen to me potter. your pal diggory, by your age he could take a whistle into a watch and have it sing you the time. miss delacour, she's as much a fairy princess as i am. as for krum, his head may be filled with sawdust but karkaroff's is not. they'll have a strategy, and you can bet that it'll play to krum's strengths. hmm? come on potter. what are your strengths? better than fair the way i heard it. you're allowed a wand. alastor moody. ministry malcontent. and your new defence against the dark arts teacher. i'm here because dumbledore asked me, end of story, goodbye, the end. any questions? when it comes to the dark arts, i believe in a practical approach. but first, which of you can tell me how many unforgivable curses there are? and they are so named? will earn you a one way ticket to azkaban. correct. now the ministry says you're too young to see what these curses do. i say different! you need to know what you're up against, you need to be prepared, you need to find somewhere else to put your chewing gum other than the underside of your desk mr finnigan! so, which curse shall we see first? give us a curse. ahhh yes, your father would know all about that. gave the ministry quite a bit of grief a few years ago. perhaps this will show you why. hello. what a little beauty. don't worry. completely harmless. but if she bites... she's lethal! what are you laughing at? talented isn't she? what shall i have her do next? jump out the window? drown herself? scores of witches and wizards have claimed that they only do did you-know-whose bidding under the influence of the imperious curse. but here's the rub, how do we sort out the liars? another.. another.. come on come on. longbottom is it? up. professor sprout tells me you have an aptitude for herbology. correct! correct! come come. particularly nasty. the torture curse. perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable curse miss granger. the killing curse. only one person is known to have survived it. and he's sitting in this room. son. you alright? come on, we'll have a cup of tea. i want to show you something. i'll teach you to cast when someone's back is turned. teaching. technically it's a ferret. is that a threat! i could tell you stories about your father that would curl even your greasy hair boy! it doesn't end here! he might've mentioned it. come with me. hate to break up this scholar session but professor mcgonagall would like to see you in her office. not you potter, just weasly and granger. exactly. presumably potter is well prepared by now and could do with a good night's sleep. go. now! longbottom! why don't you help potter put his books back.",1196
Albus Dumbledore,"i should have known that you would be here...professor mcgonagall. i'm afraid so, professor. the good, and the bad. hagrid is bringing him. ah, professor, i would trust hagrid with my life. no problems, i trust, hagrid? the only family he has. exactly. he's better off growing up away from all that. until he is ready. there, there, hagrid. it's not really goodbye, after all. good luck...harry potter. i have a few start of term notices i wish to announce. the first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. also, our caretaker, mr. filch  has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. thank you. let the feast...begin. sillllleeennnnceeeee!  everyone will please, not panic. now, prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. teachers will follow me to the dungeons. another year, gone! and now, as i understand it, the house cup needs awarded and the points stand thus. in fourth place: gryffindor, with 312 points!  in third place: hufflepuff, with 352 points!  second: ravenclaw, with 426 points!  and in first place, with 472 points: slytherin house!  yes, well done slytherin, well done slytherin. however, recent events must be taken into account and i have a few last minute points to award.  first, to miss hermione granger, for the cool use of intellect while others were in grave peril: fifty points!  second, to mr ronald weasley, for the best played game of chess that hogwarts has seen these many years: fifty points!  and third, to mister harry potter, for pure love and outstanding courage, i award gryffindor house: sixty points! and finally: it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. i award ten points to neville longbottom!  assuming that my calculations are correct, i believe that a change of decoration is in order!  gryffindor wins the house cup! back again, harry?  i see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised. i trust by now you realize what it does. let me give you a clue. the happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is. yes...and no. it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. but remember this, harry. this mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. that is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and i must ask you not to go looking for it again. it does not do to dwell on dreams, harry, and forget to live. good afternoon, harry. ah. tokens from your admirers? what happened down in the dungeons between you and professor quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows.  ah, i see your friend ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. fine. they're both just fine. relax, dear boy. the stone has been destroyed. my friend nicholas and i had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. he has enough elixir to set his affairs in order. but yes, he will die. ah. you see, only a person who wanted to find the stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. that is one of my more brilliant ideas. and between you and me that's saying something. ah, i'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. harry, do you know why professor quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him?  it was because of your mother. she sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark.  no, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. it lives in your very skin. love, harry, love.  ah. bertie bott's every flavor beans. i was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavored one, and since then i have lost my liking for them. but i think i could be safe with a nice toffee... mm. alas. earwax. before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for professor sprout and madame pomfrey, whose mandrake juice has been so successfully administered to all who had been petrified. also, in light of the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled. argus! argus, i everyone will proceed to their dormitories immediately. everyone except you three. she's not dead, argus. she has been petrified. but how she has been petrified, i cannot say innocent until proven guilty, severus. we will be able to cure her, argus. as i understand it, madame sprout has a very healthy growth of mandrakes. when matured, a potion will be made which will revive mrs. norris. and in the meantime, i strongly recommend caution to all. there's been another attack. it meansthat our students are in great danger. the truth. tell them hogwarts is no longer safe. it is as we feared, minerva. the chamber of secrets has indeed been opened again. they are not. i am well aware of our bylaws, severus, having written quite a few of them myself. however, as head of gryffindor house, it is for professor mcgonagall to determine the appropriate action. harry? oh, and about time, too. he's been looking dreadful for days. pity you had to see him on a burning day. fawkes is a phoenix, harry. they burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn from the ashes. ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. they can carry immensely heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers. hagrid. hagrid! relax. i do not believe that harry attacked anyone. yes. no, harry. i do not think it was you but i must ask you, is there something you wish to tell me? very well, then. off you go. you both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have broken perhaps a dozen school rules? and there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled. therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive special awards for services to the school. and now, mr. weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these release papers to azkaban? i believe we- we want our gamekeeper back. harry first, i want to thank you, harry. you must have shown me real loyalty down in the chamber. nothing but that could have called fawkes to you. and, um second, i sense that something is troubling you. am i right, harry? i see. well, you can speak parseltongue, harry. why? because lord voldemort can speak parseltongue. if i'm not mistaken, harry, he transferred some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar. not intentionally, but yes. it's true, harry. you possess many of the qualities that voldemort himself prizes. determination, resourcefulness, and if i may say so, a certain disregard for the rules. why then did the sorting hat place you in gryffindor? exactly, harry! exactly! which makes you different from voldemort. it is not our abilities that show what we truly are. it is our choices. if you want proof why you belong in gryffindor, then i suggest that you look more closely at this. be careful. ah- it would take a true gryffindor to pull that out of the hat. when the governors learned that arthur weasley's daughter was taken into the chamber, they saw fit to summon me back. curiously, lucius, several of them were under the impression that you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the first place. i beg your pardon? oh, yes. voldemort. only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means of this. fortunately, our young mr. potter discovered it. one hopes that no more of lord voldemort's old school things should find their way into innocent hands. the consequences for the one responsible would be severe. riddle! come. it is not wise to be wandering around this late hour, tom. i'm afraid they are, tom. they are true. i understand tom, but i'm afraid headmaster dippet may have no choice. is there something you wish to tell me? very well, then. off you go. good evening, hagrid. i wonder, could we? i want it understood, cornelius, that hagrid has my full confidence. well, what exactly is it that you want with me? calm yourself, hagrid. if the governors desire my removal, i will, of course, step aside. however, you will find that help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it. welcome! welcome to another year at hogwarts! now, i'd like to say a few words... before we all become too befuddled by our excellent feast. first, i'm pleased to welcome professor r.j. lupin... who's kindly consented to fill the post... of defense against the dark arts teacher. good luck, professor. our care of magical creatures teacher... has decided to retire... in order to spend more time with his remaining limbs. fortunately, i'm delighted to announce... that his place will be taken by none other... than our own rubeus hagrid. finally, on a more disquieting note... at the request of the ministry of magic... hogwarts will, until further notice, play host to the dementors of azkaban... until such a time as sirius black is captured. the dementors will be stationed at every entrance to the grounds. now whilst i've been assured... that their presence will not disrupt our day-to-day activities... a word of caution. dementors are vicious creatures. they'll not distinguish... between the one they hunt and the one who gets in their way. therefore, i must warn each and every one of you... to give them no reason to harm you. it is not in the nature of a dementor to be forgiving. but you know, happiness can be found... even in the darkest of times... if one only remembers to turn on the light. ah, thank you. very good. i didn't really expect him to linger. quite remarkable, yes. many. each as unlikely as the next. not a single professor inside this castle would help sirius black enter it. i'm quite convinced the castle is safe... and i'm more than willing to send the students back to their houses. perhaps. but for now, let him sleep. for in dreams, we enter a world that's entirely our own. let them swim in the deepest ocean or glide over the highest cloud. make way. come on, move. mr. filch? round up the ghosts. tell them to search every painting in the castle to find the fat lady. keep moving! dear lady, who did this to you? secure the castle, mr. filch. the rest of you, to the great hall. scabbers? i do, miss granger. but the word of three 13-year-old wizards will convince few others. a child's voice, however honest and true... is meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. mysterious thing, time. powerful... and when meddled with, dangerous. sirius black is in the topmost cell of the dark tower. you know the laws, miss granger. you must not be seen. and you would do well, i feel, to return before this last chime. if not, the consequences are too ghastly to discuss. if you succeed tonight... more than one innocent life may be spared. three turns should do it, i think. oh, and by the way. when in doubt, i find retracing my steps to be a wise place to begin. good luck. well? did what? good night. no, minister. over this way. yes, that's the... lings you see over there... on the slope... ah, hagrid. i'd like to have a cup of tea. now, now, hagrid. now, come on. all right. it'll be all right. minister, i really think i should sign as well. it's such a very long name... here we are, minister. follow me. now, look there. look beyond the rocks. professor dippet had that ling planted when he was headmaster. and all the strawberries, you see?. over there. over there. all right. how extraordinary. i don't think the minister's suggesting you had anything to do with this. how could you? you've been with us all the time. well, search the skies, if you must, minister. meanwhile, i'd like a nice cup of tea or a large brandy. oh, executioner, your services are no longer required. thank you. arresto momentum! i beg a few moments of your attention, as i have a few start of term announcements. right off, our caretaker, the good mr. filch, has reminded me for what he says is the four-hundred and sixty-second time that he had an annually updated list of various banned items, usually introduced by our humour experts fred and george weasley... ... which are posted in an extensive list on the door to mr. filch's door. also, we have two staffing changes this year. professor grubby-plank will be taking the post of care of magical creatures post as professor hagrid is on...extended leave. additionally, we have professor umbridge, who has kindly agreed to fill the post of defense against the dark arts-- professor mcgonagall, and...ah... what can i do for you? how did you see this? how were you positioned when you saw it? is arthur seriously injured? you were listening? raise the alarm. we must make sure arthur is found by the right people. many of our previous headmasters and mistresses have portraits in other institutions, allowing them to move between them. fawkes, we will need a warning. naturally, naturally. what news? good. minerva, the rest of the weasleys will need to be awoken. phineas. phineas, i need you to visit your other portrait. tell sirius what happened and that we are coming to stay for a while. i'm not sure that's true, professor. in point of fact, when young potter met those students it was not illegal. again, quite correct. however, i wonder if you have any evidence that proves this group has been meeting since then? correct again. i must confess that i was, however, under the impression that this young girl only told you a meeting was going on tonight. again, i cannot have you manhandling my students, professor umbridge. well, minister. you've caught me. quite correct, cornelius. quiet, harry! ah, yes. i was wondering when we'd hit that little snag. but i do. you seem to be laboring under the delusion that i would 'come quietly.' naturally. all of you did rather well on your spellwork at this school, but if you attempt to take me in by force, i'm afraid i shall have to hurt you. are you all right? i'm not going into hiding. fudge will soon regret removing me from hogwarts. it's fine. now listen to me, harry. keep studying occlumency! do everything professor snape tells you. close your mind! you will understand, in time. fudge is stirring. lay back down. they must not think we have had time to talk. please sit, harry. i understand how you feel, harry-- you forget that sirius was my friend too. you are not the only person on this earth capable of feelings, harry. there is no shame in feeling pain, harry. it is your greatest strength... what can't i know? this pain is part of being human, harry... you do care. you care so much you feel like you will bleed to death because of it. no. i daresay i can. and if you actually do attack me with that wand, harry, i'm afraid to say you will regret it. it is my fault sirius died tonight. harry, i owe you this explanation, to show you the failings of an old man. haven't you wondered why i haven't spoken to you, even looked at you, for months? sirius told me you believed there was a snake inside of you. this was voldemort attempting to manipulate you. to protect you from this, i had you study occlumency. yes. i thought he could overcome his feelings towards your father, but i was wrong. some wounds cut too deep to be healed. i would trust severus snape with my life, harry. you have never recovered from your mistrust of him in your first year. again, some wounds run too deep to be healed, harry. severus and sirius never liked each other at school. this has never changed. during your occulumency lessons, professor snape discovered that you were dreaming about the door in the department of mysteries. yes. voldemort has been obsessed with hearing that prophesy since he returned. because of your scar, what he was obsessed with, you were obsessed with, in the form of dreams. once he discovered the connection, voldemort had little difficulty in manipulating you into thinking he had captured sirius. kreacher lied. he wanted you to go to the department of mysteries. kreacher has been serving two masters for some months now. ah. apparently kreacher had injured buckbeak to distract him in case you tried to contact headquarters. sirius was tending to the wounds when you called. she was quite right, harry. kreacher is what wizards have made him. he is to be pitied, not hated. he didn't hate kreacher himself. kreacher was a reminder to sirius of the home he had always hated. i was trying to save his life! i also knew that voldemort would return one day. i played to his weakness. there is an ancient magic which voldemort has always underestimated. this magic is what your mother gave you when she died. that protection would only work, however, if you were cared for by a blood relative. your aunt, petunia. perhaps not. but she took you in, however grudgingly. as long as you can call your aunt's house your home, you are protected. and now we come to the moment of terrible truth, the moment i have dreaded for fifteen years. the moment when i must lay another burden atop your already straining shoulders. do you remember your first year here? when you lay in the hospital wing fresh from your confrontation with voldemort? do you remember what you asked me that night? you have no idea the pain it causes me to tell it to you, even now. but unfortunately, i must. an excellent question, harry. the answer lies in the prophesy. that was not the only place the prophesy is preserved. interestingly, there were two boys whom the prophesy could have been referring to. you and neville longbottom. voldemort had an informant listening to my meeting with professor trelawney. fortunately he was discovered before he could hear the entire prophesy. voldemort had to act immediately, he didn't know the rest of the prophesy. all he knew was that he had to destroy the child who would grow to be a threat to his power. there is a room in the department of mysteries which is kept locked at all times. it contains a force so wonderful and yet terrible that it is greater than death itself. it is that power which you have incredible amounts of and of which voldemort has none. there is only the end of the prophesy which we haven't addressed. it states ""neither can live while the other survives."" it is the final burden which i must place on you, harry. yes. oh, i agree with you, professor umbridge. you do have the power to dismiss my teachers. however... -..-you cannot send them from this happily, that will not be necessary. i have found a successor ...the ministry can only appoint new teachers if i cannot find one. i think you will find him suitable enough. this is firenze. witness for the defence, albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore. only if the dementors are still taking their orders from only the ministry these days. i believe you know my views on this, cornelius. excellent. you should not have come here tonight, tom. there are other ways to destroy a man, tom. you are quite wrong, tom, as you have always been. stay where you are, harry! harry! are you all right, harry? if you and your men will proceed to the death room, you will find several death eaters which i and some others have apprehended. minister, you have just seen you- know-who in the flesh only seconds ago! it is time to come to your senses! if you insist on trying to arrest me, i am perfectly willing demonstrate how useless such an attempt will be. i will explain everything, minister. just as soon as i return harry to school. minister, you will order the removal of dolores umbridge from my school. all educational decrees will be nullified and you will call off the search on hagrid so he can return to work. i will return here later tonight, after i have seen to harry. it should not take long. he taps the golden centaur head. portus. the second war has begun, minister. thank you... now we're all settled in and sorted, i'd like to make an announcement. this castle will not only be your home this year but home to some very special guests as well. you see hogwarts has been choosen... so hogwarts has been choosen to host a legendary event. the tri-wizard tournament. now for those of you who do not know, the tri-wizard tournament brings together three schools for a series of magical contests. from each school a single contestant is selected to compete. now let me be clear, if choosen you stand alone. and trust me when i say these contests are not for the faint hearted, but more of that later. for now please join me in welcoming the lovely ladies of the beauxbatons academy of magic and their headmistress madam maxime. and now our friends from the north, please greet the proud sons of durmstrang and the high master igor karkaroff. igor. not to worry madame maxime, our gamekeeper hagrid's more than capable of seeing to them. your attention please! i would like to say a few words. eternal glory, that is what awaits the student who wins the tri-wizard tournament. but to do this that student must survive three tasks. three extremely dangerous tasks. for this reason the ministry has seen fit to impose a new rule. to explain all this we have the head of the department of international magic cooperation mister bartimus crouch. my dear old friend, thanks for coming. silence! the goblet of fire. anyone wishing to submit themselves for the tournament merely write their name upon a piece of parchment and throw it in the flame before this hour on thursday night. do not do so lightly, if choosen there's no turning back. as from this moment the tri-wizard tournament has begun. sit down please. and now the moment you've all been waiting for, the champions selection! the durmstrang champion is ... viktor krum! the champion from beauxbatons... fleur delacour the hogwarts champion... cedric diggory. excellent! we now have our three champions! but in the end only one will go down in history. only one will hoist this chalice of champions, this vessel of victory the tri-wizard cup! harry potter. harry potter? harry potter! today we acknowledge a really terrible loss. cedric diggory was as you all know, exceptionally hard working, intricately fair minded. and most importantly a fierce fierce friend. i think therefore you have the right to know exactly how he died. you see, cedric diggory was murdered by lord voldemort. the ministry of magic does not wish me to tell you this. but not to do so i think would be an insult to his memory. now the pain we all feel at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds us that while we may come from different places and speak in different tongues, our hearts beat as one. in light of recent events the bonds of friendship we made this year will be more important than ever. remember that and cedric diggory will not have died in vain, you remember that. and we'll celebrate a boy who was kind and honest and brave and true right to the very end. i never liked these curtains. set them on fire in my fourth year, by accident of course. i put you in terrible danger this year harry i'm sorry. priori incantatem. you saw your parents that night didn't you? they reappeared. no spell can reawaken the dead harry i trust you know that. dark and diffiult times lie ahead. soon we must all face the choice between what is right what is easy. but remember this, you have friends here. you're not alone. what do you suggest minerva? you heard barty the rules are clear. i agree with severus. alastor, keep an eye on harry will you? don't let him know though, he must be anxious enough as it is... knowing what lies ahead. then again, we all are. a man has died here. and he won't be the last, you must take action. then for once show them some. but surely that is what's right, no matter what others think. oh not necessary harry the minister and i are done. i'll be back in a moment. minister, after you. harry do feel free to indulge in a liquorice snack in my absence, but i have to warn you they're a little bit sharp. curiosity's not a sin harry, but you should exercise caution. it's a pensieve, useful if like me you find your mind a wee bit stretched. it allows me to see what small things i've already seen. you see harry i've searched and searched for something, some small detail. something i might have overlooked, something that would explain why these terrible things have happened. every time i get close to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning. he was sent to azkaban. destroyed barty to do it. but he had no choice, the evidence was overwhelming. why do you ask? have there been other dreams like this? i think it's unwise for you to linger over these dreams harry, i think it's best that you simply... cast them away. good day champions. gather round please. now you've waited, you've wondered and at last the moment has arrived. the moment only four of you can fully appreciate. what are you doing here miss granger? barty. the bag. very well. good luck champions. mr diggory the sound of the cannon... three of our champions have now faced their dragons and so each one of them will proceed to the next task. and now our fourth and final contestant. welcome to the second task. last night something was stolen from each of our champions. a treasure of sorts. these four treasures, one for each champion, now lie on the bottom of the black lake. in order to win each champion need only find their treasure and return to the surface. simple enough. except for this, they will have one hour to do so and one hour only. after that they'll be on their own. you may begin at the start of the cannon. the beauxbatons champion miss delacour has unfortunately been forced to retire. she will take no further part in this task. harry! i want all the judges over here now. attention! attention! the winner is... mr diggory! for showing unique command of the bubblehead shark. the way i see it, mr potter would have finished first had it not been for his determination to rescue not only mr weasly but the others as well. we've agreed to award him second place! for outstanding moral fibre. harry! did you put your name in the goblet of fire? did you ask one of the older students to do it for you? you're absolutely sure? that doesn't help alastor. leave this to you barty. the counsel is very much aware you have given evidence on this matter. severus snape was indeed a deatheater and prior to lord voldemort's downfall turned spy for us at great personal risk. today he's no more a deatheater than i am. earlier today professor moody placed the tri-wizards cup deep within the maze. only he knows its exact position. now as mr diggory... and mr potter tied for first position they will be the first to enter the maze. followed by mr krum... the first person to touch the cup will be the winner. i've instructed the staff to patrol the perimeter, if at any point should a contestant wish to withdraw from the task he or she need only send up red sparks with their wands. contestants, gather round. in the maze you'll find not dragons or creatures of the deep. instead you'll face something more challenging. you see, people change in the maze. oh find the cup if you can, but be very weary you could just lose yourselves along the way. on the count of three... one... harry! harry! tell me what happened! it's alright harry. it's alright, he's home, you both are. severus... do you know who i am? are you alastor moody? are ya? is he in this room? is he in this room? harry get away from there! are you alright alastor? now we know who's been stealing it from your store severus. we'll get you up in a minute. barty crouch junior. your arm harry. send an owl to azkaban, think they'll find they're missing a prisoner. perhaps. personally i've never had much time for heroes. the very best of evenings to you! first off, please join me in welcoming the newest member of our staff, horace slughorn. professor slughorn, i'm happy to say, has agreed to resume his old post of potions master.  meanwhile the post of defense against the dark arts will be assumed by professor snape. now, as you know, each and every one of you was searched upon your arrival tonight.  you have a right to know why. once there was a young man who, like you, sat in this very hall. walked this castle's corridors. slept beneath its roof.  he seemed, to all the world, a student like any other.  his name? tom riddle. the hall goes utterly silent. today, of course, the world knows him by another name.  which is why, as i stand looking out upon you all tonight, i am reminded of a sobering fact.  each day, every hour, this very minute perhaps, dark forces attempt to penetrate this castle.  but in the end, their greatest weapon remains... you. just something to keep in mind. now, off to bed.  pip pip! quick thinking on your part, harry.  using a bezoar.  you must be very proud of your student, eh, horace? why indeed. this appears to be a gift, horace. you don't by chance remember who gave you this bottle, do you -- which by the way possesses remarkably subtle hints of licorice and cherry when not polluted with poison. to whom might i ask? ah, to be young and feel love's keen sting.  come, everyone, i think mr. weasley is well tended. good evening, harry.  you got my message, i see.  come, come.  sit. so.  how are you? enjoying your classes?  professor slughorn, for one, is most impressed with you. do you? and what of your activities outside the classroom?  do they bring you satisfaction? i notice you spend a great deal of time with miss granger.  one can't help but wonder if -- forgive me, harry, i... ... i was merely curious. in any event, i'm sure you're wondering why i've summoned you here tonight.  the answer lies here. what you see before you are memories.  in this case pertaining to one individual:  voldemort.  or as he was known then... tom riddle. this vial contains a most particular memory -- of the day i first met him.  i'd like you to see it.  if you would... did i know that i had just met the most dangerous dark wizard of all time?  no.  had i... over time, while here at hogwarts, tom riddle grew close to one particular teacher.  can you guess which teacher that might be? no.  i did not.  you see, professor slughorn possesses something i desire very dearly. and he will not part with it easily... i'd rather not divulge any more just yet, harry.  but i promise. in time you will know everything. i did. yes. confused?  i would be surprised if you weren't. this is perhaps the most important memory i've collected.  it's also a lie. this memory has been tampered with.  in this case by the person whose memory it is, our friend professor slughorn. i suspect he is ashamed of it. why indeed. i asked you to get to know professor slughorn and you've done so. now i want you to persuade him to divulge his true memory.  any way you can. you're the chosen one, harry.  and horace is, at heart, a decent man. provide the proper circumstances and he will confess his sins. this memory is everything, harry. without it, we are blind. without it, we leave the fate of our world to chance.  you have no choice. you must not fail. this is beyond anything i imagined.  in my life i have seen things that are unimaginably horrific.  i know now... you will see worse. oh he succeeded.  and not just once.  think, harry.  he's just told us. they can be anything.  the most commonplace of objects.  a ring, for example.  or a book... it's a horcrux, yes.  four years ago, when you saved ginny weasley's life in the chamber of secrets, when you brought me this i knew.  this was a different kind of magic.  very dark.  very powerful.  but until tonight, i had no idea just how powerful... belonged to voldemort's mother. it was difficult to find and... one destroys voldemort. true.  but magic, especially dark magic... ... leaves traces. yes.  and i think... perhaps... i may have found another.  but this time i cannot hope to destroy it alone. once again, i shall ask too much of you. i am not family.  but his name has been known to me since birth. perhaps you could give me an example. how do you do, tom. as you wish. no.  i am a professor. perhaps they're right. hogwarts is not a place for mad people. it's a school.  a school of... magic. you can do things, can't you, tom? things the other children can't. tell me some of the things you can do, tom. i'm like you, tom.  different. i think there is something trying to get out of your wardrobe, tom. open it.  open.  it. take it out. is there anything in that box you ought not to have? why did you want these things, tom? thievery is not tolerated at hogwarts.  at hogwarts, you will be taught not only how to use magic, but to control it. understood? i'll be going now, tom.  leave your window open tonight.  an owl will bring you a message.  read it carefully. it is unusual.  but not unheard of. how is he?  horace? i once knew a muggle girl from liverpool with hair like spun silk.  no light could resist it... rather unpleasant to behold, isn't it?  the tale is thrilling if i do say so myself, but i'm afraid now is not the time to tell it.  take my arm. indeed.  and quite successfully i might add.  most people vomit their first time. welcome to the charming village of budleigh babberton, harry.  i assume right about now you're wondering why i've brought you here, am i right? wand out, harry. lumos... horace! i must say, you make a very convincing armchair, horace. dragon's blood. ah yes.  introductions.  harry, this is an old friend and colleague of mine, horace slughorn.  horace, this is, well, you know who this is. apparently there's some thought he may be the chosen one. so why all the theatrics, horace? you weren't perhaps expecting someone else, were you? take matters into their own hands? well, i think it should be put back in order for them, don't you? mind? that was fun.  may i use the loo? mind if i take this?  i do love knitting patterns. i think i know a lost cause when i see one.  regrettable.  i would have considered it a personal triumph had you consented to return to hogwarts, horace.  you are, like my friend mr. potter -- one of a kind. indeed they are. you are talented, famous and powerful -- everything horace values.  professor slughorn is going to try to collect you, harry.  you would be his crowning jewel.  that is why he is returning to hogwarts.  and it is crucial he return... i fear i may have stolen a wondrous night from you, harry. she was, truthfully, very pretty. the girl. you'll not be going back to little whinging tonight, harry. both are waiting for you. whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.  i will not negotiate this with you, severus.  you agreed.  there's nothing more to discuss. harry.  you need a shave, my friend. at times i forget how much you've grown.  at times i still see the small boy from the cupboard. forgive my mawkishness, harry.  i am an old man. like your mother, you are unfailingly kind. a trait people never fail to undervalue.  i'm afraid. the place to which we journey tonight is exceedingly dangerous, harry.  i promised that you could accompany me and i stand by that promise.  but there is a condition:  you must obey any command i give you -- without question. understand what i'm saying. should i tell you to hide, you must hide. should i tell you to run, you will run. and should i tell you to abandon me and save yourself... you will do so. your word, harry. take my arm. being me has its privileges. no.  severus... severus is who i need... go and wake him... tell him what has happened... speak to no one else... i... i shall wait here... no, harry.  i do not pray.  i was merely closing a window -- the one that had allowed us to apparate. hide yourself below.  and do not speak or show yourself without my permission.  no matter what. do as i say, harry. trust me. good evening, draco.  what brings you out on such a fine spring evening?  or is it summer? i often talk aloud to myself.  i find it extraordinarily useful. that which sounds sane at a whisper can seem utterly mad when said for all the world to hear. haven't been whispering to yourself, have you, draco? you are not an assassin, draco. like cursing katie bell and hoping she would, in turn, bear a cursed necklace to me?  like replacing a bottle of mead with one laced with poison.  forgive me, draco, but these are attempts so feeble i cannot help but question if your heart has been really in them. i'm curious.  when voldemort gave you this task, when he asked you to kill me, was it in a whisper? then i shall make it easy for you. well done, draco.  but i warn you. killing is not nearly as easy. you're not alone.  are you.  there are others.  how? that cabinet has been broken for years. ingenious.  let me guess.  it has a sister.  a twin. a passage, yes.  very good. i once knew a boy years ago who made all the wrong choices.  let me help you, draco. say that again, draco.  but aloud this time. good evening, bellatrix.  i think introductions are in order. severus... severus... please. this is the place.  oh yes, this place has known magic. where you stand, harry, tom riddle once stood many, many years ago, when he was but a poor orphan boy with a penchant for cruelty... one wintry afternoon, he lured two younger classmates to this cave. what happened is unclear.  but this much is known:  the children were damaged. in order to gain passage, payment must be made, payment intended to weaken any intruder. oh, no, harry.  your blood is much more precious than mine. careful.  the water. it's there.  the only question is how do we get to it? perhaps not. if you would, harry... only recreationally.  you see, i believe one creates one's own luck. yes. remember... the water. oh yes. it has to be drunk. you remember the condition on which i brought you with me? this potion might paralyze me.  it might cause me to forget why i'm here.  it might create so much pain i beg for relief.  you are not to indulge these requests, harry.  it is your job to make sure i keep drinking this potion even if you have to force it down my throat.  understood? because i am much older, much cleverer... and much less valuable. your good health, harry. don't... don't make me... nooooooo!!! make it stop... please... make it stop... my fault.  it's all my fault... too much... i can't... take it... i want... to die... kill... kill me... kill me, harry! your word, harry!  your word! kill me!  it's the only way! water. water... aguamenti. water! go... we have to... go. i am not worried, harry.  i am with you. that wasn't my intention. stand up, severus. i haven't much time. what message do you bring from lord voldemort this time? is this about the prophecy? how much did you relay? the prophecy did not refer to a woman. it spoke of a boy born at the end of july -- if she means so much to you, surely lord voldemort would spare her in exchange for the boy. you disgust me. you would sacrifice the life of an innocent child over a schoolboy crush? and should i do so, what will you give me in return, severus? lily and james put their faith in the wrong person. rather like you, severus. the boy survives. he has her eyes. the dark lord will return. and the boy will be in terrible danger when he does. my word that i shall never reveal the best of you, severus? if you insist. sometimes we see what we expect to see, severus. other teachers indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average gifts. personally, i find him rather engaging. perhaps. ooh. severus. i was... foolish... greedy... for the time being? how long? well, this makes matters much more straightforward. do not ignore me, severus. was it not you who told me of lord voldemort's plan to have the malfoy boy murder me? you must agree. yes. you must be the one to kill me, severus. it is the only way. only then will the dark lord trust you completely. there will come a time when harry potter must be told something. but you must wait until voldemort is at his most vulnerable. on the night lord voldemort went to godric's hollow to kill harry, and lily potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. when that happened, a part of lord voldemort's soul latched itself onto the only living thing it could find: harry himself. there's a reason harry can speak with snakes. there's a reason he can look into lord voldemort's mind. a part of lord voldemort lives inside him. but this is touching, severus. don't tell me you've grown to care for the boy? lily. after all this time? the irony of course, severus, is that -- in the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing... you cannot help. harry. you wonderful boy. you brave, brave man. let us walk. oh, yes. not. did. it was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than voldemort himself. you were the seventh horcrux, harry; the horcrux he never meant to make. certain? no. little is certain in this world, harry. call it an educated guess. i was going to ask you that. where would you say that we are? king's cross! is that right? well, this is, as they say, your party. you will have to forgive me, harry. you see... i didn't trust i feared that you would make the same mistake i made, that you would be intoxicated by the power the hallows promise their possessor. but i crave your pardon, harry. it's clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you are the better man. you are the worthy possessor of the hallows, harry, not me. i was fit to own the elder wand, because i took it not for gain, but to save others from it. but i took the stone because i longed to recall someone who has long been at peace and for that i paid with my life. yes. true. but ask yourself this: were you calling them? or were they calling you? that is up to you. oh yes. we are in king's cross, you say? i think, should you so decide, you would be able to, let's say, board a train. on. true. yes. 'help will always be given at hogwarts to those who ask for it.' i have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in my i've never put much stock in miracles, harry. on the other hand, i can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon. luck. do not pity the dead, harry. pity the living and, above all, those who live without love. actually, if i think about it... it doesn't seem curious at all. of course it is happening inside your head, harry. but why should that mean that it is not real?",7653

""by order of the ministry of magic: dolores jane umbridge will replace albus dumbledore as head of hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry."" my first act as your new headmistress is to form an inquisitional squad, lead by draco malfoy. they will report directly to me about the goings on in the halls of this school. furthermore, our good caretaker, mr. filch has requested we reinstate the 'old punishments.' i have decided that there is no reason we shouldn't. ready to try out the old punishments again? so, turning a hallway into a swamp is funny, is it? well, now you're going to learn what happens to wrongdoers in my school. well, now you're going to get your that's enough for tonight, potter. let's see that hand. since i had received information some time ago that potter and a number of other students had met in the hog's head to start an illegal group-- i'm sorry? but two days later, educational decree twenty-four was introduced. i have a witness right here! let's ask her, shall we? you can shake your head for an what do you mean by shaking your head, girl? but what about potter? he was the why are you shaking your head, girl? my apologies, headmaster. i forgot myself. hmm, let's see, five points from gryffindor for coming in late. now, as i was saying before mr. potter interrupted with his antics, your defense against the dark arts education has been rather fragmented and disjointed in your past classes, hasn't it? i will be following a pre-approved ministry-prepared, theory-centered defense lesson plan. copy this down. yes? well, they should be perfectly self- evident. miss granger, this class has been approved by ministry experts. are you a ministry expert? then you have no business challenging those who are. we will be learning about spells in a safe, risk-free environment- ten points from gryffindor, mr. potter. let me set the record straight. some of you have been told that a certain dead wizard has returned. this is a lie. mr. potter, you have just landed yourself in detention! the boy's death was a tragic accident. mr potter, you have earned yourself a week's worth of detentions! that goes to professor mcgonagall, dear. you think you could simply walk into my office without me knowing about it? foolish boy! accio wand! who were you trying to contact? draco, would you fetch professor snape, please? very well, potter. i have been patient enough with you. i have just caught potter trying to communicate with someone in my fire. i need some veritaserum. truth syrum. we've played nicely, potter. you you could have saved me a lot of trouble if those dementors i sent to your house had finished you off! of course i did! someone had to act! well, well. shut up, potter! now talk, you silly girl! who were you talking to? tell him? you and mr. potter will take me to it. i can do whatever i wish! not anymore. now remove yourself from this castle! i have the authority, headmaster! and what of her quarters when i appoint a new teacher. excuse me, dumbledore, but did you just accused the ministry of magic of ordering an attack on this boy? much further, is it? your forest? this forest belongs to the ministry of magic! stay back, you beasts! you cannot attack me! any attack on a wizard by a half-breed-- come no closer! incarcerous! ingrates! animals! filthy half- bloods! i thought you might need some additional authority in dealing with these two. i hardly think that's an adequate punishment for this. educational decree twenty-five. it gives me, as high inquisitor, the power to give punishments and privileges, and to alter those given out to students by other members of the staff. so, i think a life-long ban from playing quidditch should do the trick for both of these. oh, and this one's twin as well. he was going to attack malfoy as well. yes, indeed, mr. potter. ah, i'll take your brooms as well. well, have a wonderful day. and how long have you been at this post? i understand you are the descendent of the famous seer cassandra trelawney? and you are the first since cassandra to have the second sight? of course. now, if you would kindly make a prediction for me? the inner eye does not see upon command! well, if that's the best you can do, professor, i will be going. ah, potter. sit down. you're going to be doing lines, tonight, mr. potter, and you'll be using this quill. you will write ""i will not tell lies"" until i tell you to stop. understand? oh...you won't need ink. problem, potter? that's enough for this evening. same time, tomorrow, and we'll see if we can get the message to sink in a bit deeper.",958

uhh, uhhh all right there, scarhead? training for the ballet, potter? you'll never catch me, potter! that's right. and that's not all that new this year. you see weasley, unlike some, my father can afford the best. no one asked your opinion, you filthy little mudblood! ha, ha! ha, ha i'll bet you loved that, didn't you, potter? famous harry potter! can't even go into a bookshop without making the front page. oh look, potter. you've got yourself a girlfriend. see you at school. well, sit down. you'd never know the weasleys were pure-bloods, the way they behave. they're an embarrassment to the wizarding world. all of them. what's wrong with you, crabbe? you know, i'm surprised that the daily prophet hasn't done a report on all these attacks. i suppose dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. father always said dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place. what? you think there's someone here who's worse than dumbledore? good one, goyle. you're absolutely right. saint potter. and people actually think that he's the heir of slytherin! you know i don't goyle. i told you yesterday. how many times do i have to tell you? is this yours? but my father did say this: it's been fifty years since the chamber was opened. he wouldn't tell me who opened it-- only that they were expelled. the last time the chamber of secrets was opened, a mudblood died. so, it's only a matter of time before one of them is killed this time. as for me, i hope it's granger. what's the matter with you two? you're acting veryodd. hey! where are you going? potter. is it true you fainted? i mean, you actually fainted? it comes and it goes. still, i consider myself lucky. madam pomfrey said another minute and i could've lost my arm. i couldn't do homework for weeks. now i'll tell you. father said... i can keep the hippogriff's head. i think i'll donate it to the gryffindors' room. this is going to be rich. look who's here. come to see the show? not a word to anyone, understood? exactly how do we do that? don't be such a wimp, longbottom. oh, yeah. terribly funny. really witty. god, this place has gone to the dogs. wait until father hears dumbledore's got this oaf teaching classes. d-dementor! dementor! oh, please. yes you're not dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute! it's killed me! it's killed me! oh you're gonna regret this. you and your bloody chicken! not a word to anyone, understood? i'm gonna get that jumped-up mudblood! mark my words. this class is ridiculous. well, well. look who's here. you two shopping for your new dream home? bit grand for you, isn't it, weasle-bee? don't your family sleep in uh... one room? uh, not very friendly. boys, i think it's time we teach weasle-bee how to respect his superiors. how dare you talk to me! you filthy little mudblood! who is that? don't stand there! do something! get out of the way! move! god, i can't wait until all you weasleys have been expelled. your stench has been fouling this castle for too long. that's for speaking to me. you know, you weasleys are just as bad as mudbloods! you know, weasley, it's really too bad potter saved you from the chamber of secrets. i should thank you, weasley. you're definitely our best player! bet you loved that, potter! saved weasley's neck, didn't you? i've never seen a worse keeper! maybe we should add some more verses to our little song. about his filthy mother! and his pathetic loser of a father too! but then, you like the weasleys, don't you? how can you stand the stink?

 i heard you talking. how do you know what i am?  i've done things that would shock you. he trusts me!  i was chosen! expelliarumus! the vanishing cabinet in the room of requirement. i've been mending it. in borgin & burkes.  they form -- i don't want your help!  don't you see!  i have to do it!  i have to! i've got to kill you or he'll kill me. what just happened?  blaise? hogwarts.  what a pathetic excuse for a school.  i think i'd pitch myself off the astronomy tower if i thought i had to continue on for another two years. let's just say i don't think you'll be seeing me wasting my time in charms class next year. amused, blaise?  we'll see just who's laughing in the end. you two go on.  i want to check something. didn't mummy ever tell you it's bad manners to eavesdrop, potter? petrificus totalus! oh, right, she was dead before you could wipe the drool off your chin. enjoy the ride back to london. it's a not a cane, you cretin. it's a walking stick. is my father's.  he's not dead. nice face, potter. cruci-- don't touch me!  don't you dare touch me! potter! harry turns. draco's hand whips forward and -- to harry's shock -- tosses him his wand. ron grins. take my hand. well, well, what brings you here, potter? harry looks slowly over his shoulder. draco -- blaise and goyle at his side -- steps into view, his face bisected by light. he holds a wand on harry. i virtually lived here last year. remember? easy. give me my wand.",1275

Elphias Doge,"mr. potter!  by all means! i certainly knew him the longest, if you don't count his brother aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count aberforth. yes, well, dumbledore was always very private.  even as a boy. the occasional owl.  though it was strange... it was the owls themselves.  they often arrived in distress.  it was clear they'd traveled great distances in some cases. i'm afraid not.  albus' messages mostly referenced our days together as schoolboys.  they were surprisingly intimate.  when he did speak of his current activities his words would turn elliptical.  still, i sensed he was under great stress.  why do you ask? well, he treasured you, mr. potter, i can attest to that.  i can also tell you that when a person passes, it's only natural to rue the things left unsaid, to regret the question never asked. i knew albus nigh on 100 years, but in many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me. that woman is a vulture, muriel, and you well know it. i'm sorry you think so, muriel.  i assure you i was writing from the heart. a monstrous betrayal.  i can only conclude the rumors are true and that she has become untethered. nice meeting you, mr. potter!",211

Firenze,"harry potter, you must leave. you are known to many creatures here. the forest is not safe at this time. especially for you. a monstrous creature. it is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. but at a terrible price. you have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. a cursed life. can you think of no one? do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment? harry potter, this is where i leave you. you're safe now. good luck.",112

Harry Potter,"yes, aunt petunia. yes, uncle vernon. he's asleep! sorry about him. he doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.  can you...hear me?  it's just...i've never talked to a snake before. do you...i mean...do you talk to people often?  you're from burma, aren't you? was it nice there, do you miss your family?  i see. that's me as well. i never knew my parents, either. anytime. ow! i swear i don't know!  one minute, the glass was there and then it was gone! it was like magic! will i have to wear that, too? but that's dudley's old uniform. it'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin. hey, give it back! it's mine! because there's no post on sunday? get off! ahh! they're my letters! let go of me! ahh! nothing... nothing, i'm fine. not slytherin. not slytherin. not slytherin...anything but slytherin. wow. say, percy, who's that teacher talking to professor quirrell? what's he teach? where's hermione? how could a troll get in? hermione! she doesn't know! what's seamus trying to do to that glass of water? can i borrow this?  thanks. hey, ron, somebody broke into gringotts, listen.  believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. the vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. that's odd. that's the vault hagrid and i went to. i'm not hungry. that explains the blood. listen, last night, i'm guessing snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. but, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping. the day i was at gringotts, hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. he said it was hogwarts' business, very secret. that's what the dog's guarding. that's what snape wants. but i-i never get mail. it's a broomstick! but who...? one minute. thanks, hagrid. but hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from hogwarts. you know that. i'm not going home. not really. i think she heard you. i think she fancies you. my scar. it keeps burning. not like this. i think it's a warning. it means dangers coming. uhh!  oh. of course! don't you think it's a bit odd that what hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one?  i mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? why didn't i see it before? hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?  what did he look like? the stranger, though, you and he must have talked. and did he seem interested in fluffy? we have to see professor dumbledore, immediately! he's gone?! now? but this is important! it's about...the philosopher's stone. someone's going to try and steal it. that was no stranger hagrid met in the village. it was snape, which means he knows how to get past fluffy. we go down the trapdoor. tonight. trevor. now, neville, listen. we were let's go.  sorry. knight to e5. happy christmas, ron.  what are you wearing? i-i've got presents? your father left this in my possession before he died. it is time it was returned to you. use it well. it's some kind of cloak. my body's gone! i'm invisible? there was no name. it just said use it well. but he's weak. he's living off the unicorns. don't you see? we had it wrong! snape doesn't want the stone for himself; he wants the stone for voldemort. with the elixir of life, voldemort will be strong again. he'll... he'll come back. i think if he'd had the chance, he might've tried to kill me tonight. it's going into the girl's bathroom! hermione, move! whooa! whoa, whoa! whoa, whoa whoa! do something! anything! hurry up! i don't think so. just knocked out.  ew. troll bogies. well, what it is... good for you to get us out of trouble like that. mind you, she didn't need saving if you hadn't insulted her. mum?  dad? ron! you've really got to see this! ron! you've got to see this!  ron, ron, come on. get out of bed! there's something you've got to see. now, come on! come on. come. come look, it's my parents! look in properly. go on. stand there. there. you see them, don't you? thats my dad how can it? both my parents are dead. no. no. so, then it shows us what we want? whatever we want? admirers? ron was here? is he all right? what about hermione? but, what happened to the stone? but flamel, he'll die, won't he? how is it i got the stone, sir? one minute i was staring in the mirror, and the next... does that mean, with the stone gone, i mean, that voldemort can never come back? what is it? all right there, ron? all right. hermione? i don't know, sir. i don't know, sir. clearly, hermione knows. since it's a pity not to ask her. wow. neville! give it here, malfoy. give it here, malfoy, or i'll knock you off your broom! i think so. what are those? what is that? i like this ball. what do i do with it? whoa. hagrid! we know about the philosopher's stone! we think snape's trying to steal it. hagrid, we know he's after the stone. we just don't know why. what? wait a minute.  one of the teachers? uh, hagrid, what exactly is that? norbert? malfoy. hagrid always wanted a dragon. he told me so the first time i met him. i don't understand. is that bad? 50?! who knows? why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on halloween? yes? but, hagrid, whatever fluffy's guarding, snape's trying to steal it. exactly. nicholas flamel? nicholas flamel.  who's nicholas flamel? a little. what happened? yes!  whoa! yes! whoa! whooa! a century, according to mcgonagall. but i've never even played quidditch. what if i make a fool of myself? i-i didn't know. platform 9&¾? but, hagrid, there must be a mistake. this says platform 9&¾. there's no such thing...is there? excuse me, excuse me. excuse me, sir. can you tell me where i might find platform 9&¾? muggles? excuse me! c-could you tell me how to- hagrid, what's that? if i didn't know better, draco, i'd say you were scared. what is it, fang? but what was that thing you saved me from? but who would choose such a life? do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was voldemort? the philosopher's stone. hey, hagrid. i think i can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks. we got lost. hi, hedwig. malfoy. i found him! go on. i knew the name sounded familiar. i read it on the train that day. the what? shh! snape's already been here. he's put a spell on the harp. we have to move its paw. come on!  okay. push!  i'll go first. don't follow until i give you a sign.  if something bad happens, get yourselves out...does it seem a bit...quiet? jump! go! who doesn't? what's happening? let's go this way. does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here? let's go. run! quick! let's hide though that door! it's locked! and for good reason. guarding something? whoa!  oh. ahh! hermione!! hermione! where are you?! yeah, yeah, i'm fine. apparently not. what? ron, are you okay? okay. lucky hermione pays attention in herbology. i don't know. sounds like wings. they're not birds, they're keys. and i'll bet one of them fits that door. i don't know. strange. there! i see it!  the one with the broken wing! it's too simple. catch the key! where are we? a graveyard. there's the door. wait a minute. no, ron! no! he's going to sacrifice himself! ron!  no! don't move! dont forget, we're still playing.  checkmate.  take care of ron. then, go to the owlery. send a message to dumbledore. ron's right...i have to go on. not as good as you. you?  no. i-it can't be. snape, h-he was the one-- but-but that day, during the quidditch match, snape tried to kill me. snape was trying to save me? then-then you let the troll in. i-i'm shaking hands with dumbledore. i've won the house cup. voldemort. never! you liar! make a wish, harry. i-i am. thank you! excuse me, who are you? sorry, no. learned what? i-i'm a what? no, you've made a mistake. i can't be...a-a wizard. i mean, i'm just... harry. just harry. dear, mr. potter. we are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at hogwarts' school of witchcraft and wizardry. you knew? you knew all along and you never told me? blown up? you told me my parents died in a car crash! muggle? okay. first year students will require: three sets of work robes, one wand. one pair of dragon-hide gloves.  hagrid, do they mean for a real dragon? but you like a dragon? all students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. could we find all this in london? oh, nice to meet you. goodbye. but why am i famous, hagrid? all those people back there, how is it they know who i am? he killed my parents, didn't he? the one who gave me this. you know, hagrid, i know you do. maybe if you wrote it down? voldemort? me? voldemort tried to kill...me? what happened to...to you-know-who? but, hagrid, how am i to pay for all this? i haven't any money. uh, hagrid, what exactly are these things? what's in there, hagrid? i still need...a wand. hello? hello? sorry, but what's curious? and...who owned that wand? wow. no, not at all. i'm harry. harry potter. the what? oh we'll take the lot! bertie bott's every flavour beans? these aren't real chocolate frogs, are they? i got dumbledore! hey, he's gone! a little. yeah! i think we're going to need another feather over here, professor. famous fire eaters...15th century fiends...flamel...nicholas flamel...where are you? time for the teary farewell. they'll torture you.  even dudley. if they think you know where i'm going, they'll stop at noth-- do you have any?  magic? absolutely not.  besides, i'm just a waste of space.  isn't that right, vernon? well... thanks. see you, big d. good riddance. i thought you were looking after the prime minister, kingsley. the trace? the real one...? no!  absolutely not! if you think i'm going to let people risk their lives for me -- this is different.  taking that. becoming me -- no. blimey, hermione! yes? here. it gets really tricky. this is completely mental. i'm nobody. apparently so. are those...? the ministry must be hiring young these days. how long did you say this batch of polyjuice potion would last, hermione? ron.  you don't have a wife. look, we'll go with you -- ron's been coming here since he was two years old.  it's us you should be worrying about. i say if we don't locate umbridge within the hour, we go find ron and come back another day.  deal? accio locket. ron, it's me. she went down to the courtrooms with umbridge -- arthur!  you know you're being tracked, don't you? no, arthur.  it's a fact.  they're watching you. i'll tell you later.  let's find hermione. it's here... you're lying.  and one mustn't tell lies, dolores... stupefy! expecto patronum! do you reckon everyone's alright at the wedding?  maybe we should -- same. my rucksack.  with all my things. i left it back at the burrow -- you're joking. down! stupefy! lock the door, get the lights. this one's name is rowle.  he was on the astronomy tower the night snape killed dumbledore. it's better we wipe their memories.  we kill them, they'll know we were here. how is it they knew we were there? hermione.  i appreciate the thought -- honestly.  but given that we were almost killed by a couple of death eaters a few minutes ago... i have an idea. mad-eye...? lumos. yeah.  they knew her.  she wrote a history of magic, you know. i'm thinking maybe we should go talk to her.  she still lives in godric's hollow.  i'm thinking maybe she could help us. to the dark lord.  i know i will be dead long before you read this... i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it... stop!  i order you! been spying on us, have you? ever seen this before? kreacher, i own this place. sirius left it to me.  which means i own you too. that's right.  but there were two, weren't there? where's the other one? answer her. how do you mean? where is it now?  did someone take it, kreacher? who, kreacher?  who was it? find him. you mean... it remembers me? when you turned this place over -- don't deny it! -- you found a locket, am i right? who was she?  this witch? hagrid!  we've got to help the others! what was that? hagrid... hagrid...! is no one back yet? are you mad...? a grindylow! who did this to him? hedwig -- i think.  she was trying to protect me -- i trust you with my life, hagrid. i trust everyone in this room. understood? no one else is going to die.  not for me. come with me.  now. wedding? i don't care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. i have to start searching for the horcruxes.  it's the only chance we have to beat him.  and the longer we wait the stronger he gets. yes. dumbledore didn't want anyone to know what it is we're doing.  if i tell you, i'd be betraying him. maybe that's the best reason to have it.  because of everything that's going on. to what do we owe the pleasure, minister? and this would be...? what's this all about? no idea. that's it then? excuse me? you'll forgive me, minister.  but it's a little hard to tell the difference these days. you mean -- but that's brilliant -- i... don't know what to say. no, 'course not.  how are you, luna? nice to meet you, sir. sir?  may i sit down? i found what you wrote in the daily prophet very moving, sir.  i take it you knew professor dumbledore well? i never even knew he had a brother, sir. sir, i was wondering if you'd had much contact with him before he died. strange, sir? could you tell me from where they'd come, sir? just curious.  i was... close to professor dumbledore. who are you talking about? who? oh, right.  slipped my mind... godric's hollow?  bathilda bagshot lives in godric's hollow? excuse me?  you don't mean to say dumbledore lived there too? accio dittany. hermione.  his arm -- what happened?  i thought we were going back to grimmauld place. don't be stupid. what're you doing? tent?  where am i supposed to find -- they're great. no problem. how bad is he? dumbledore had a theory.  he felt that the horcruxes would not be made out of random objects.  and he felt they wouldn't be hidden randomly either.  we know of three so far.  the ring, which according to dumbledore belonged to tom riddle's grandfather.  the diary, which belonged to tom himself. and this, which -- again, according to dumbledore -- belonged to his mother. how d'you know? i know.  i felt it too. it's... it's like it's ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it's -- that's why we're going to kill it. dissendium! expulso! we have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it. no. it's not a candle i can blow out, hermione.  it always burns, even if it's just a flicker.  can you understand that? he's found him.  vol-- you-know-who.  he's found gregorovitch -- yes.  how'd you know? you-know-who wants something gregorovitch once had -- dunno what.  but he's desperate to have it.  it's as if his life depends on it. well it sets my teeth on edge. what's he expecting to hear?  good news? and what gets you through the day? how long before he can travel? you're not doing enough. loads. snatchers. good to know your enchantments work. we have to leave.  we're not safe here. then we'll go by foot. we're all hungry. it'll be dark soon.  we need to find a place to sleep. my turn. maybe you could tell me now. brilliant. o-kay. with a basilisk fang.  if you tell me you've got one of those in that bloody beaded bag of yours -- it only takes in that which makes it stronger... ... it can destroy horcruxes. you're brilliant, hermione. truly. there's only one problem... what's the problem? look, don't be shy.  if you've got something to say, spit it out. i thought you knew what you signed up for. i don't understand.  what part of this isn't living up to your expectations?  did you think we'd be staying in five-star hotels? finding a horcrux every other day? did you think you'd be back to mummy by christmas? i've told you everything dumbledore told me! and in case you haven't noticed, we've found a horcrux! yeah, he would.  d'you think i haven't noticed the two of you whispering behind my back?  d'you think i haven't guessed what you were thinking? you think i don't listen!  you think i don't know what it's like -- go then.  but leave that. salvio hexia... protego totalum... you were right.  it's like you said.  snitches have flesh memories.  but i didn't catch my first snitch with my hand.  i almost swallowed it. what do you reckon it means? luna's dad was wearing that, at ron- at bill and fleur's wedding. around his neck.  like an amulet. i didn't think much of it at the time.  you know luna -- she's always got some mad thing or the other she's carrying around.  i just figured it ran in the family. hermione, i've been thinking.  i -- i want to go to godric's hollow. it's where i was born, it's where my parents died -- but it means something to him too, hermione.  you-know-who nearly died there.  wouldn't that be just the kind of place he'd hide a horcrux? godric's hollow is the birthplace of godric gryffindor -- i mean, 'course it is.  obvious, isn't it? tossed it at neville once when he was snoring -- might've popped open. hermione... no.  this is where i was born. i'm not returning as someone else. do you think they'd be in there? my mum and dad? is it -- ? no. happy christmas, hermione. yeah. c'mon. we look like ordinary muggles. relax.  this is right.  i know it. this is where they died, hermione. this is where he murdered them. you're bathilda, aren't you? hermione, she knew dumbledore. she might have the sword. besides, she's barely knee-high to a house-elf.  i think we can overpower her if it turns ugly. she's gaga, remember? here.  let me do that. miss bagshot?  who is this man? his name.  can you tell me his name? this is him, hermione.  the one i saw in gregorovitch's wandshop. the thief.  miss bagshot, who is he? she wants us to go upstairs. she wants me to go.  alone. it's all right.  you stay here. lumos. yes. yes. we got away. are you alright? you've outdone yourself this time. where are they? who is he, hermione?  the thief? did dumbledore know him? well? tell me, hermione.  who is he? hermione, i don't need to have read a history of magic to know who gellert grindelwald is. get to the hard part, hermione. and dumbledore believed in it? 'for the greater good.'  what does that mean? we're young, hermione.  and here we are, risking our lives to fight against the very thing dumbledore supported. where's my wand?  i'll take the watch. hermione.  where's my wand? it's done. it's done. leave me yours.  you get back in the warm.  and give me that. no... lumos! accio sword. diffindo. hermione... it was you! and the doe.  that was you as well. my patronus is a stag. you didn't see anyone else? but i reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in that pool hoping we'd find it. see that?  it knows.  it's afraid. do it. all the more reason. then why are you here?  why did you come back? i'll have to speak to it in order for it to open.  when it does, don't hesitate.  i don't know what's in here, but it'll put up a fight.  the bit of riddle that was in his diary tried to kill me. on three.  one.  two.  three. take me inside... stab it, ron.  now. don't listen to it. ron.  don't listen to it! ron.  stab it! we were better without you, happier without you. ron.  it lies!  stab it!  stab it! your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a son... do it, ron!  kill it! after you left, she cried for a week.  she's like my sister. you've sort of made up for it tonight.  getting the sword. finishing off the horcrux. that too. hermione! fine.  actually... more than fine. um... i don't know? it's a long story. it's a long story. exactly how did you find us? it? knew what? keep talking 'bout that little ball of light touching your heart -- she'll come round. yeah... engorgio. reducio! nothing. sorry? jesus.  it was there too. outside gregorovitch's wand shop. on the alley wall... not still mad at him, are you? they've kidnapped luna because he supported me.  he was just desperate. they exist.  the hallows. but he only wants the one, the last one.  that's what he's been looking for. he knows where it is, you-know- who.  he'll have it by the end of the night.  he's found the elder wand. dudely.  vernon dudley. the list is wrong.  i told you who i am -- what did you put on me? how long will it last? luna. hello, mr. lovegood.  i'm harry potter.  we met a few months back? would it be okay if we came in? it won't take long, sir.  i promise. well, sir, we need some help. what's going on here? well, sir, it's about something you were wearing around your neck at the wedding.  a symbol... yes!  exactly.  what we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it? the what? no. sorry... i still don't really understand... which one would you choose if you could?  of the deathly hallows? the stone. well, you could bring people back, couldn't you?  mad-eye. dumbledore.  sirius.  anybody. but i have one.  the invisibility cloak my father left me. and i think i've actually held the resurrection stone in my hands, that night in dumbledore's office when he showed me the ring he'd destroyed, the horcrux.  it had a symbol on it.  now i think it was the mark of the hallows. sir? who took her, sir? luna? help us. dobby? what are you doing here? you can apparate in and out of this room? could you take us with you? dobby, i want you to take luna and mr. ollivander-- stupefy. stupefy! hermione. you're all right. we're safe. we're all safe. dobby. dobby. no, just-- hold on. hold on. look, just hold on, okay? we'll fix you. hermione will have something. in your bag. hermione? hermione? what is it? help me. i want to bury him. properly. without magic. i can't let you out, hedwig. i'm not allowed to use magic outside of school. besides, if uncle vernon now you've done it. but she's bored! if i could only let outonly let out for an hour or two. but i haven't had any messages from any of my friends not one all summer. i'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that i don't exist. ron! fred. george. what are you all doing here? ahh- ahh! let go of me! get off! who are you? not to be to be rude or anything, but this isn't a great time for me to have a house elf in my bedroom. why don't you sit down? dobby, ssh! i'm sorry! i didn't mean to offend you, or anything. you can't have met many decent wizards then. stop, dobby! dobby, shh! dobby, please stop! stop! stop, dobby. please be quiet! are you all right? your family? what terrible things? who's plotting them? okâ i- understand. you can't- say. dobby! dobby, put the lamp down. give me the lamp! dobby stop! get in there, and keep quiet! i- i was just- sorry. yes, sir see why i've got to go back? i don't belong here. i belong in your world, at hogwarts. it's the only place i've got friends! well, i expect they've been- hang on- how do you know my friends haven't been writing to me? give me those, now! dobby, get back here! dobby, please, no! i can't. hogwarts is my home! well, we had loads of help from you. we couldn't have done it without you. well, there's no hogwarts without you, hagrid. you're doomed. oh- hi, colin. nice to meet you. thank you, sir. you wish. rictusempra! sya- hassa- she. sya- hasi- heth. sya- hasi- heth. did you hear it? that voice. i heard it first in lockhart's office. and then again just- it's moving. i think it's going to kill. strange. i've never seen spiders act like that. oh, no it's filch's cat. it's mrs. norris. no. no. it's not true sir, i swear. i never touched mrs. norris. when i said i wasn't hungry. we were heading back to the common room when we found mrs. norris. strange? do you think i should have told them? dumbledore and the others, i mean? no! mr. filch! y-you- you don't understand! professor i swear i didn't! i'll see you back in the common room. i'm ah- um reading. uh-huh. and they found it. tom riddle's diary is gone. i'm a what? i know. i mean, i accidentally set a python on my cousin dudley at the zoo once. uh, once! but, so what? i bet loads of people here can do it. what's bad? if i hadn't told that snake not to attack justin. you were there! you heard me! i spoke a different language? but- i didn't realize i- how can i speak a language without knowing i can? but i'm not i can't be. 'tom marvolo riddle.' 'my name is harry potter.' 'do you know anything about the chamber of secrets?' 'can you tell me?' ugh! uh! dobby? it was you you stopped the barrier from letting ron and me through. you nearly got ron and me expelled! your bludger? you made that bludger chase after me? you'd better clear off before my bones come back, dobby, or i might strangle you! i don't suppose you could tell me why you're trying to kill me? why do you wear that thing dobby? repeat itself? you mean this has happened before? dobby, stop it! stop it! stop, dobby! tell me, dobby. when did this happen before? who's doing it now? no, dobby. tell me. who is it? no. we've got to talk to hagrid, ron. i can't believe it's him, but if he did set the monster loose last time, he'll know how to get inside the chamber of secrets, and that's a start. i think it's time to get my dad's old cloak out again. wish you were here hermione. we need you now, more than ever. ron, this is why hermione was in the library the day she was attacked. come on! 'of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly than the basilisk. capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death awaits any who meet this giant serpent's eye. spiders flee before it.' ron, this is it. the monster in the chamber of secrets is a basilisk. that's why i can hear it speak. it's a snake! because no one did look it in the eye. not directly, at least. colin saw it through his camera. justinjustin must have seen the basilisk through nearly headless nick. nick got the full blast of it- but he's a ghost- he couldn't die again. and hermionehad the mirror. i bet you anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along. the water. there was water on the floor that night. she only saw the basilisk's reflection. 'spiders flee before it.' it all fits! hermione's answered that, too. remember what aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? she died in a bathroom? what if she never left? see you, hedwig. so, a house elf shows up in my bedroom, we can't get through the barrier to platform nine and three-quarters, we almost get killed by a tree clearly someone doesn't want me here this year. professor dumbledore. professor mcgonagall. thank you. no, i think my- i think my arm's broken. no, not you. wood! look out! professor dumbledore? i i-i was- i was just wondering if you'd put me in the right house. you're wrong. professor! sir, your bird- there was nothing i could do- he- he just caught fire! you don't think it was me, professor? no, sir. nothing. yes, sir. yes, sir. it's just you see, sir i- i couldn't help but notice certain things, certain- certain similarities, between tom riddle and me. voldemort transferred some of his powers to me? so the sorting hat was right! i should be in slytherin. because i asked it to. godric gryffindor. dobby! so this is your master! the family you serve is the malfoys don't worry. i will be. sir, i wonder if i could have that? mr. malfoy! mr. malfoy! i have something of yours. oh, i think you do, sir. i think you slipped the diary into ginny weasley's cauldron, that day at diagon alley. open it. just promise me something. never try to save my life again. excuse me. could you tell me what's going on here? are you tom riddle? dumbledore? hagrid! haagriid! woah! what's that for? hagrid, are you okay? did you hear about hermione? look, we have to ask you something. do you know who's opened the chamber of secrets? look! well, come on. come on, fang! ah! oh okay. malfoy. he called hermione, um, well, i don't- i don't know exactly what it means. what's a mudblood? that's horrible! up! up! up! up! ron! mind that tree! ahh! be thankful it's not your neck. i don't know. ahh! ahh! ahh! aaaahhhh! come on! go! fast! ahh! not really. what? that voice. didn't you hear it? spooky. stop! stop! hold still! lockhart may be useless, but he's going to try and get into the chamber. at least we can tell him what we know. professor, we have some information for you! are you going somewhere? you're running away? after all that stuff you did in your books? you wrote them! you're a fraud! you've just been taking credit for what other wizards have done! don't even think about it. floo powder? 'diaganilly.' i think it's brilliant hello. w-what did i do? raids? oh, sorry sir. i'm harry, sir, harry potter. oh, it oh, umm well, if there really is a chamber of secrets, a-and it really has been opened, then that means--- well, maybe ron's right, hermione. i mean, look at his family. the whole lot of them have been in slytherin for centuries. it was hagrid. hagrid opened the chanter of secrets fifty years ago. the monster had killed somebody, ron. what would any of us have done? no! w- what's that you've got, hagrid? malfoy? no, colin! get out of the way! let's take him to hagrid's. he'll know what to do. let's go. aah! sorry. lost- lost control of the trolley. why can't we get through? the train leaves at exactly eleven o'clock. we've missed it! maybe we should just go and wait by the car. you heard what hagrid said; 'follow the spiders.' shush! come on! don't panic. we're friends of hagrid's. and you? y- y-you're aragog aren't you? he's in trouble. up at the school, there have been attacks. they think it's hagrid. they think he opened the chamber of secrets, like before. then you're not the monster. shush. but if you're not the monster, then- then what did kill that girl fifty years ago? but have you seen it? what? well, thank you. we'll justgo. one, but it's not powerful enough for all of them. let's go! arania exumai! go! whoah! arania exumai! don't mention it. get us out of here. now! come on! come on! move faster! aah! go on! go! get us in the air. come on! pull! we know one thing. hagrid never opened the chamber of secrets. he was innocent. well, how long will it take to make? a month? but, hermione, if malfoy is the heir of slytherin, he could attack half the muggle-borns in the school by then. i'm fine, thank you. i- i was just no! please! hagrid! i was lost, i- hang on. what were you doing down there, then? well, it's great to see you, too! i definitely need to remember that one. thank you. bye. voldemort killed my parents. he was nothing more than a murderer. ron, i should tell you, most muggles aren't accustomed to seeing a flying car. well come on, then. let's go lower. we need to find the train. now all we need to do is catch up with the train. do you hear that? hold on aaahhh! aaahhhh! aaahhh! wha-aahhh! i'm trying. your hand's all sweaty. i think we found the train. crabbe and goyle. ron, maybe i should do it? wingardium leviosa. here they come. come on. let's get 'em. ughh! ron! we still sound like ourselves. you need to sound more like crabbe. excellent. hermione, are you okay? come on. i think the slytherin common room's this way. hermione, come out. we've got loads to tell you! hermione? a- are you ok? she should be out of hospital in a few days, when she stops coughing up fur balls what's this? looks like moaning myrtle's flooded the bathroom. why would i throw something at you? but, who threw it at you, anyway? to ask you how you died. who was it myrtle? just like that? how? this is it. this is it, ron. i think this is the entrance to the chamber of secrets. hesha- hassah. oh, yes there is! you first. all right. let's go. uhthanks myrtle. aaah! you're wrong! harry potter? but then you must have some idea who's behind it all. it's his stomachache. calm down. hair! now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway. this way. it's a snakeskin. ron! ron, are you ok? you wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back through. i'll go on and find ginny! hesha- hassah. ginny ginny! oh, ginny, please don't be dead. wake up. wake up! please, wake up! tom. tom riddle! what do you mean, 'she won't wake?' she's not? are you a ghost? she's cold as ice. ginny, please don't be dead. wake up! you've got to help me, tom. there's a basilisk. give me my wand, tom. listen, we've got to go! we've got to save her! no. she couldn't. she wouldn't! but why? but, why did you want to meet me? hagrid's my friend! and you framed him, didn't you? i'll bet dumbledore saw right through you. well, you haven't finished it this time. in a few hours, the mandrake draught will be ready, and everyone who was petrified will be all right again. why do you care how i escaped? voldemort was after your time. you! you're the heir of slytherin. you're voldemort. albus dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world! he'll never be gone! not as long as those who remain are loyal to him! fawkes? ginny- ginny don't worry. ginny, you need to get yourself out. follow the chamber, and you'll find ron. you were brilliant, fawkes. i just wasn't quick enough of course! phoenix tears have healing powers. thanks! it's alright, ginny. it's over. it's just a memory. uncle vernon, i need you to sign this form. nothing. school stuff. i will if she does. yes. okay. oh, yeah. yeah. i've been beaten loads of times. that's a lie! my dad wasn't a drunk! shut up! shut up! no! she deserved what she got! keep away from me. yeah? try me. i don't care. anywhere's better than here. lumos maxima. lumos maxima. lumos maxima. lumos maxima. lumos maxima! how did he find out? at least hagrid didn't get fired. what are you talking about? for me? but who sent it? sorry. mischief managed. nox. i was sleepwalking. my dad didn't strut. and nor do i. now, if you don't mind, i would appreciate it if you could lower your wand. spare bit of parchment. mr's. moony, wormtail, padfoot, and prongs... offer their compliments to professor snape and... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's business. fortuna major. thank you. she's still doing that after three years. she can't even sing. exactly. hey, man. hey, man. oh, god. that's awful. the most haunted building in britain. yeah i know. what's going on? you tell those spiders ron. probably a right sight better than he normally does. oh, brilliant. what happened? really? i meant the match. who won? i saw my dad. he sent the dementors away. i saw him across the lake. you mean they're gonna kill him? it's true. sirius is innocent. he's free. we did it. what just happened? where's ron? i don't know. going to hagrid's? i don't know. honestly, ron. how can somebody be in two places at once? why don't we just set him free? ow! hagrid! hagrid. it'll be fine. it'll be okay. what? look. buckbeak's still alive. here they come. i'd better hurry. that's pettigrew. he betrayed my parents. you don't expect me to sit here. are you mad? ow! ow! that hurt! what? get away. get off. this way. come on. this way. this way, now. now what? shut up, malfoy. what? hey, hey, hey! brilliant, professor. hermione! hermione! hermione, wait. hermione, will you please tell me what it is we're doing? that's us. this is not normal. you mean we've gone back in time? good punch. come on. we should be at hagrid's. no. professor, why do the dementors affect me so? i mean, more than everyone else? i'm scared, professor. i need to know how to fight them. you could teach me. you made that dementor on the train go away. but you made it go away. ripped to pieces? what are you talking about? they're not sacking you! sirius! no. sirius! expecto patronum! don't worry. my dad will come. he'll conjure the patronus. any minute now! right there! you'll see! don't worry, he will! he will come! sirius. expecto patronum! you were right, hermione. it wasn't my dad i saw earlier. it was me! i saw myself conjuring the patronus before. i knew i could do it this time because... well, i had already done it. does that make sense? i want to go with you. but you're innocent. my mother's eyes. how? and now we wait. wait! that's not good. ron, run! ron! ron! ron! ron! come on! move! don't worry. i have a hunch. i just hope i'm wrong. okay. no. don't worry, okay? it's fine. i'll stay. you okay? well i just didn't think my dad would have wanted his two best friends... to become killers. besides, dead, the truth dies with him. alive, you're free. i know. what? come and live with you? expelliarmus! come on. sirius! yeah. hermione? before, down by the lake, when i was with sirius... i did see someone. that someone made the dementors go away. it was my dad. my dad conjured the patronus. you see sirius talking to me there? he's asking me to come live with him. when we free him, i'll never have to go back to the dursleys'. it'll just be me and him. we could live in the country... someplace you can see the sky. i think he'll like that after all those years in azkaban. let's go! what are you doing? thanks. great! now he's coming for us. poor professor lupin's having a really tough night. sirius! come on! no. no, sir. yes, sir. professor, just so you know, i don't think that map always works. earlier, it showed someone in the castle. someone i know to be dead. peter pettigrew. it's just what i saw. good night, professor. i'm sure. expecto patronum. expecto patronum! expecto... expecto... expect... that's one nasty dementor. the first time i rode a broom. there's another. it's not... happy, exactly. well, it is. it's the happiest i've ever felt... but it's complicated. just do it. expecto patronum! expecto patronum! i think i've had enough for today. i was thinking of him. and mom. seeing their faces. they were talking to me. just talking. that's the memory i chose. i don't even know if it's real. but it's the best i have. excuse me, sir. where's professor lupin? sir, it's quidditch tomorrow. you've been sacked. resigned? why? but dumbledore... none of it made any difference. pettigrew escaped. but professor i thought if you signed it, then i could... forget about it, guys. see you later. guys, let me go. i'm trying to get to hogsmeade. let me go! come on, guys. don't... what are you doing?! what's this rubbish? mr's. moony, wormtail, padfoot and prongs... are proud to present the marauder's map. hang on. this is hogwarts. and that... no. is that really...? so you mean this map shows... everyone? brilliant! where did you get it? professor, can i ask you something? i did think of voldemort at first. but then i remembered that night on the train... and the dementor. before i fainted... i heard something. a woman... screaming. i think it was my mother... the night she was murdered. he was their friend... and he betrayed them. he was their friend! i hope he finds me. because when he does, i'm gonna be ready! when he does, i'm gonna kill him! hedwig. no, thank you. minister? i don't understand. i broke the law. underage wizards can't use magic at home. the state of things, sir? sirius black, you mean? but what's he got to do with me? hedwig. egypt. what's it like? mrs. weasley. good to see you. yes. yeah, it's all upstairs. everything's there. thank you. mr. weasley. yeah, sure. yeah. it should be great. has this anything to do with sirius black, sir? only that he's escaped from azkaban. voldemort. sorry. and kill me. mr. weasley... why would i go looking for someone who wants to kill me? i didn't mean to blow her up. i just... i lost control. i think i was lucky not to be arrested actually. do you think he's really asleep? i gotta tell you something. yeah. thanks, ron. i don't know. maybe we've broken down. thank you. what was that thing that came? what happened to me? and did either of you two... you know... pass out? but someone was screaming. a woman. i fell over. i didn't do it on purpose. nothing. i didn't. the leaky cauldron. that's in london. but the muggles. can't they see us? who is that? that man. how did he escape? yeah. him i've heard of. hang on. we better take this back. fine. see you later. professor trelawney... sorry? no. nothing. come on. ron. then it'll be you! i know why. you betrayed my parents. you're the reason they're dead! who was it, then? expelliarmus! tell me about peter. no. pettigrew's dead. you killed him! the map was lying, then. all they could find of pettigrew was his... show me. give it to him, ron. no! i know what he is. but we'll take him to the castle. get off! i said we'd take you to the castle. after that, the dementors can have you. dementors. no. we were attacked. they're evil. if they get the chance, they'll suck your soul out through your mouth. you can't give a dementor the 'ol one-two.' because i used magic to save his lumos! what are you doing here? how'd he know? it just happened! what's been going on? what's lord vol- how are we getting there? uh, is that very likely? expecto--! no! but i can help! hey, nick. oh. thanks. nick, i was wondering about something? expecting what? i expect so... why? how are you? better. i've got something to tell you. something important. but not right now. i'm not ready. do you need any help looking? yeah. i'm sorry. isn't it? what's she done now? ""by order of the hogwarts high inquisitor: all student organizations, societies, teams, groups, and clubs are henceforth disbanded. permission to reform must be approved by high inquisitor umbridge. no student organization can exist without the knowledge and approval of the high inquisitor. any student found to be a part of an illegal organization will be expelled immediately."" not only that, but what about the this isn't a coincidence. she knows. look, we don't know how many people could have overheard our meeting and told her. what would we do without you, hermione? hedwig! it's hedwig. i think she's been attacked. london. yes, professor. no--no, i've done all i can. voldemort! he's got sirius! in the department of mysteries! i just saw it. how're we going to get there? we've got to do something! i won't let sirius die! voldemort's broken into the department of mysteries. he's got sirius there! there isn't anyone else, hermione! everyone from the order is gone! no, there isn't! how? that's all we'll need. grimmauld place! sirius! lupin? hello? kreacher, where's sirius? you know where he is, don't you? i've been thinking about something dumbledore said to me. that even though we've got a fight ahead of us we've got one thing that voldemort doesn't have. something worth fighting for what? why? what did i do? where'd she get that from? no one believes me, hedwig. no one... i'm alone... mr. weasley's been attacked! no, i saw it happen! i...i was there... no, i haven't. she is. but the quill has some sort of spell on it. it uses blood for ink. no, i'm telling anyone. no! i don't need his help. i don't need anyone's help. i've asked sirius about it. don't worry, hermione, i wrote it in code. anyway, i figured i need to tell someone about umbridge. my scar hurt again last night in detention. well, it's a possibility, isn't it? yeah, but dumbledore didn't have a choice, did he? she'd been sent here by the ministry. what's that, professor? voldemort can read minds? so he could read our minds right now? but hasn't it helped so far? i mean, it saved mr. weasley's life, didn't it? what are you going to do? no! i've been there before... i've just realized... what's in the department of mysteries, sir? that corridor, i've been dreaming about it for months...it leads to the department of mysteries, i'm sure of it. yeah. no! i--sorry! no, of course not! oh. uh...i was the snake. i saw it from the snake's perspective. yes! professor, no! i'm so sorry, professor! no you don't! you don't have a clue! you can't possibly know! i don't care! i don't care! let me out. you can't keep me in here! i already know all this. well, yeah, i did... but snape stopped giving me lessons. he barely taught me, though. i always felt more open to it after the lessons. like he was trying to open me to voldemort-- sirius didn't trust him. didn't believe he'd really turned to our side... i've been dreaming about that all year, before voldemort discovered the connection. but i checked grimmauld place! kreacher said-- why? what? wait, where was sirius when i tried to contact him? and hermione said we should be nice to kreacher! sirius hated him. yeah, he really hated that place. and you kept him locked up in there! she never loved me. i asked you why voldemort tried to kill me. i don't understand, professor. professor, why am i so important to sir, it got smashed. i'm not sure i understand all that, sir... and...it means me? so it's not necessarily me, sir? what if he chose wrong? why didn't he wait? why attack when we were babies? but i don't have any special powers. what is it, sir? one of us has to kill the other...in the end. sorry, professor... what good's theory in the real world? what about lord voldemort? it-is-not-a-lie! so, according to you, cedric diggory dropped dead? or are you calling me a murderer? it was murder! i saw it happen! yeah, talk to somebody who cares. yeah. but she called me a liar! yes, professor. oh! sorry... i'll never get out of it, angelina. later, i've got detention. thanks. it's none of your business. he's got padfoot at the place it's hidden! you sent the dementors? hermione, no! i would rather die! er...sorry. yes. yes, but- yes, but- yes. but i did it because of the dementors! my cousin and i were attacked by dementors. that's why i had to use the patronus, to drive them away. look out! professor! bye. department of mysteries? i've been there before... all right, come on. where is everyone? that's how voldemort got in unnoticed. this is it. come on. stay close. i don't understand. in my dream, yeah. i'll know the way when i see it. who's there? sirius? does anyone else hear that? sirius...yeah... alohomora! whatever's in there, the ministry sure doesn't want anyone getting to it. this is it! come on! this is it. this is where sirius is! he's in here somewhere. what's my name doing here? why not? it's got my name on it! where's sirius? what prophesy? go ahead. come and find out! you even try to take her and i'll smash this thing. so, what kind of prophesy are we talking about here? not really. how come voldemort wants it? hey, did you know voldemort's a half-blood too? what's so special about this what? so he used me to do his dirty work, did he? now! where'd the rest go? stupify! stupify! ron! pretificus totalus! hermione! please don't be dead, please don't be dead... he shakes her. can we carry her? i don't know... what happened. we need to get out of here. luna, can you help ginny? let my friends go and i will. stop, neville! are you all right? you come with us! protego! no...no...no.... i'll kill you!! stupify! crucio! can't. it got smashed by accident! how's voldemort going to like that? you've failed him, and he's not very forgiving, is he? he can't hear you from here, you know! it's got to be. probably. mr. weasley was probably there when he was attacked, too. that must be what the order's guarding! they're all death eaters! voldemort. was that your--? but...why here? mrs. weasley! right. so, why's he keeping me in the dark? didn't you bother asking? so i get to spend the summer with the dursleys while you two are here. you've still been here! what's been going on? what's this order everyone's talking about? why? okay. i'm not really hungry. i think i'll go to bed. i wanted to, but i didn't think you'd tell me anything. where's voldemort? what's he doing? how? and what's his plan? and you're stopping him from gaining followers? but...why? but you're telling people, right? what? what kind of weapon? no, my scar kept hurting. yeah...nerves... thanks, hermione. big d? cool name, but to me, you'll always be ikkle duddicums. what? shut up, dudley. i'm warning you... because if you don't i'll turn you into the idiot pig you are! not so brave now, are you duddykins? now tell your little friends to go away. don't you ever speak about that again. you understand? i said, do you understand? ! quiet! dudley! run! come on! they break into a run. a dementor drifts into the alleyway in front of them. skidding to a stop, harry turns around, to find the other dementor cutting off the way back. dudley, no! lumos! ""expecto patronum!' ""expecto patronum! ' i think so, yeah. er...is percy mad at you? what are you doing here? if he wanted to talk to the minister, why down here? yeah...just...my scar...the pain is getting stronger. my parents. i miss them, sirius... why'd they have to die, sirius, why? thanks. who..who was that? are you sure you can't? hagrid said it was important. could you tell us what it is, hagrid, please? great plan, hermione. we've got no brooms. what are those? all right, then. get on one, and we'll be off. yeah. where are we going, hermione? hermione, what's going on? you mean about us teaching ourselves? hey, neville. uh...same to you, luna. that's the first time you've said his name. it's okay, hermione. i believe voldemort's back because i fought him last year. dumbledore's already told the school that. if you didn't believe him you won't believe anyone. me? uh...well, yeah, i did. that might work. i'll look into that. dobby! what are you doing here? what is it, dobby. don't worry about it, dobby. but i don't think you can help me. actually, there is something you can do, dobby. i need a room where twenty-eight people can practice defense against the dark arts without the teachers knowing. especially professor umbridge. that's brilliant, dobby! better not, dobby. school is pretty intense right now. we'll do it ina few months, before the holidays. just ignore them, ron! malfoy provoked us. ban us...for life. you've--! you can't! if you quit, we'll be out four players! hagrid, what happened to you? we know you were looking for giants, hagrid. dumbledore said so last year. so what did you do when you found them? glad to see all of you could find this place all right. loads of defense against the dark arts equipment. hopefully we'll be able to get to all of it before the end of term. besides, it works. i used it against you-know-who last june. it saved my life. right. well, let's split into pairs and give it a go. well done, neville! look here, you lot! neville's really got the hang of this one. never forget this spell, neville. it could save your live some day. okay, everyone. we've done a lot today, and i've seen some great improvement. that's it for now. we'll meet back here, same time next week! i'm sure. nothing. so...congratulations ron, hermione... yes, do go enjoy yourselves. what is that? yes it is, it's right there! er...you are? well, thanks luna. hagrid's cabin looks deserted. yeah, could be. er... there's no ink. well there's something you don't see every day. i don't know but i don't think it's pumpkin juice. well it does match your eyes. is there a bonnet? my dress robes. well i expect yours are more traditional. leave it alone. who? because we'd take the mickey out of her if she did. ready professor? no. yeah she does. what? why do they always have to travel in packs? how are you supposed to get one alone to ask them... i think i'd take the dragon right now. but then again he can take himself. agreed. yeah well rather you than me. yes sir. bubble juice sir? i haven't stolen anything. let you know what? i didn't ask for this to happen ron. okay? you're being stupid. i didn't put my name in that cup. i don't want eternal glory i just wanna be.. look, i don't know what happened tonight and i don't know why, it just did ok. who wants me to open it? you want me to open it? what the bloody hell was that? caught on have you. took you long enough. brilliant. that makes me feel loads better. hagrid warned me about the dragons. who could possibly figure that out? that's completely mental. professor, when i was in the graveyard there was a moment... um... when voldemort's wand and mine sort of connected. what happened to you? what did she say? don't be silly. what did you do then? hey! sirius? sirius?! how... no! i dunno. no. umm.. voldemort was giving him a job to do. something important. he wanted... me. i dunno why, but he was gonna use this man to get to me. i mean it was only a dream right? what are you saying? do you think one of them put my name in the goblet? i'm not ready for this sirius. someone's coming! who says i was talking to anyone. maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't be the first time. i can come back later professor. sir, mr crouch's son, what happened to him? it's just that i had a dream about him. it was in the summer, before school. in the dream i was in a house and voldemort was there only he wasn't quite human, and wormtail was there too and mr crouch's son. yes. always the same one. sir... these dreams, what i see, you don't think it's actually happening do you? yeah. battle a dragon. the horntail... nothing. you're sure about this neville. for an hour. most likely? you're telling me this now? you must be joking. well that makes you sight better than ron and hermione. where are they anyway? do i? but she's my friend too! hermione i finished last hermione. neville! you're doing it again! magical water plants of the highland lochs? is that right? well.... what? well you can tell ronald... mr crouch? no sir. no sir. yes sir. it's a broomcupboard. oh, no. i'm fourteen. i dunno i haven't really thought about it. fourteen. no i didn't enter. hey, my eyes aren't glistening with the ghosts of my past. agh! professor? fleur? fleur! no stop! he's bewitched cedric. he's bewitched! for a moment so did i. some game. together, on three. one, two, three! he's back, he's back! voldemort's back. cedric, he asked me to bring his body back. i couldn't leave him, not there. yeah, you? i've been here before. i've been here before in a dream. cedric, we have to get back to the cup? now! get back to the cup! cedric! don't touch him. have it your way. not so much now. the cup was a portkey. someone had bewitched it. who? i dunno. it was like i'd fallen into one of my dreams. one of my nightmares. um. i don't think i said anything about a graveyard professor. it was you from the beginning. you put my name in the goblet of fire. you bewitched krum. but... that's moody, but then who's...? oh... um... you know i just thought i'd... um... i dunno.. i can fly. i mean i'm a fair flyer. but i'm not allowed a broom. no i don't think so. yes. hermione. bad dream. when did you get here? last night. where are we actually going? yes sir. this way. pleasure to meet you too sir. why are they all standing around that manky old boot? what's a 'portkey'? thanks. excuse me.. can i have a word? dragons. that's the first task. they've got one for each of us. yes. don't worry about it. you're a right foul git you know that? i know so. yeah. stay away from me. i don't give a damn what you or your father thinks malfoy. he's vile and cruel, and you're just pathetic. yeah i brought the cloak. hagrid where are we going? what's with the flower? hagrid have you combed your hair? dragons? that's the first task? you're joking. ron was here? no he didn't. he didn't tell me a thing. oi! never gonna let him forget this are you? come seek us where our voices sound. an hour long you'll have to look. potentially problematic? when was the last time you held your breath under the water for an hour hermione? neville. no offense, but i really don't care about plants. now if there's a tibetan turnip that will allow me to breathe underwater for an hour then great. really? i had no idea. i suppose viktor's already figured it out. what's that supposed to mean? cedric. spectacular. forget about it. i'm sure you would have done the same for me. cho! ok thanks. cho? um.  i just wondered if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me? um. i was just wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the ball with me. ok. great. fine. no problem. good. it's alright i'll get it. oh no thank you i'm not hungry. i'm fine. thanks. see ya later cedric. i love magic. when we're apart my heart beats only for youuu! what is that?

or twenty. really?  honestly, i reckoned she was starting to annoy you. excuse me? well... brilliant. bloody well hope so.  she's been snogging you for three months. who're you talking about? okay.  very funny. what the hell was that for? okay!  fine!  you're in love with her!  have you ever actually met her! ron, these chocolates, they're -- c'mon.  i'm going to introduce you to romilda vane. what does she see in him? you called him a slick git not five hours ago. i suppose. i don't know.  she's smart. funny.  attractive... you know.  she's... got nice skin. well, no.  i mean... i'm just saying it could be a contributing factor. i've never really thought about it.  but i suppose, yeah.  very nice. i think i'll be going to sleep now. what? oh.  yeah. say that again. excellent.  really excellent. right.  i'm going down to hagrid's. no.  i've got a good feeling about going to hagrid's.  i feel like it's the place to be tonight, know what i mean? trust me.  i know what i'm doing. or at least felix does. ever heard of this spell? no. it's... old.  the binding is fragile. i didn't say i wasn't curious. and, by the way, i don't sleep with it. yep.  apparently it's his lucky day. yeah.  i suppose i could've just used, i dunno... a confundus charm? ah.  well... they're really good. it feels like this. well, sir, i wondered if i might ask you something. well, you see, the other day i was in the restricted section -- in the library -- and i stumbled upon something rather odd while reading.  something about a bit of rare magic... i'm not sure... that is, i don't recall the name... exactly.  but it got me wondering... are there some kinds of magic you're not allowed to teach? yes, well, we don't exactly see eye-to-eye, sir.  what i mean to say is, he's not like you.  he might... misunderstand. did you say the same to tom riddle, sir?  when he came asking questions. sir -- devastatingly handsome. sir.  i'm sorry.  i wouldn't bother you if it weren't absolutely -- i figured this called for a more practiced hand, sir. i'm sorry, sir.  about the other day.  our... misunderstanding. i mean, i'm sure you're tired of it, after all these years.  the questions.  about... voldemort. yes, sir.  it's just, well, dumbledore once said that fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.  it seemed sensible. love potion. ron!  ron!!!  professor, help him! professor!  do something!! he's choking!! breathe!  c'mon, ron, don't be a prat.  breathe!  breathe! um, sorry, sir, but i haven't got my book yet -- nor's ron.  you see -- crush it.  don't cut it. no.  really -- what? sorry, sir, i was just admiring your hourglass. i think i'll be going. the shelf, sir? i don't really know how to answer that, sir. did voldemort ever make the shelf, sir? you knew him, didn't you, sir? tom riddle.  you were his teacher. what was he like? i'm sorry, sir.  forgive me.  he killed my parents, you see... neville...? what're you doing? and what's happened to you? cormac!  that's who you invited! i think she went to powder her nose. dragon balls. i think i should rejoin the party, sir.  my date... a message...? traveling?  where? fine, sir. i think he overestimates my abilities, sir. definitely. sir? no!  i mean... she's brilliant. and we're friends.  but... no. did you know, sir?  then? you didn't bring professor slughorn back simply to teach potions, did you, sir? you said professor slughorn would try to collect me. do you want me to let him? i don't understand -- what happened? but why would he tamper with his own memory? why? i don't know him that well, sir -- sir -- do you mean to say he succeeded, sir?  in making a horcrux? seven.  he made seven -- the most powerfully magical number.  but... what are they exactly? tom riddle's diary -- and the ring...? ... even more difficult to destroy. but if you could find them all. if you did destroy each horcrux... but how would you find them?  they could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they... it's where you've been going, isn't it, sir?  when you leave the school. that would be counterproductive, sir. no idea. a dead one, i think, sir. not to mention the pincers. through the front doors. oh yeah. do you know why i survived?  the night i got this. because of her.  because she sacrificed herself.  because she refused to step aside.  because her love was more powerful than voldemort. i'm not afraid of the name, professor.  and i'm not afraid of him.  and you shouldn't be either. she didn't just die for me that night.  she died for you too.  she died for everyone who's ever woken in the middle of the night afraid a death eater waited on their doorstep. professor.  i'm going to tell you something, something others have only guessed at.  it's true.  i am the chosen one. only i can kill him.  but in order to do so, i need to know what tom riddle asked you that night in your office all those years ago. and i need to know what you told him. be brave, professor.  be brave like my mother.  otherwise you disgrace her.  otherwise she died for nothing.  otherwise, the bowl remains empty forever. cruciatus! incacerata! impedimenta! fight!  fight back, you coward! sectumsempra! hagrid... hagrid! hagrid!  you alright? hagrid, dumbledore -- all right!  queue up!  excuse me... thanks.  all right.  this morning i'll be putting you all through a few drills to assess your strengths.  but know this:  just because you made the team last year does not guarantee you a spot this year.  is that clear? all right.  cormac.  ron.  it's down to you two for keeper.  we'll decide it with a shootout. demelza, you'll bring the quaffle up against cormac.  ginny, you'll take on ron. quiet!  i'm captain.  we do it my way.  now line up.  on three. one.  two... three! c'mon, ron... draco's plotting something, i know it, something to do with voldemort.  he's been given a task or a mission -- and snape was offering to help. i know it sounds mad -- that's not what it sounded like. but dumbledore can make mistakes. he's said it himself -- i'm not -- it's good. are you alright, mr. weasley? did you get my owl? go on. a vanishing cabinet? what happened to it?  the one at borgin & burkes? soon. i like riding round on the trains. it takes my mind off... things. oh.  um.  no one.  bit of a tosser. really. hey.  i was wondering... i just apparated, didn't i? can't imagine why... after all these years, i just sort of roll with it, sir. my mother's eyes, yeah. one of my best friends is muggle- born.  she's the best in our year. sir, exactly what was that all -- it's alright, sir.  i'll go back tomorrow, make some excuse -- but, sir.  what about hedwig?  and there's my trunk -- sir? really. didn't know. dumbledore. when'd you get here? oh come on... but we're talking about hogwarts. dumbledore. what could be safer? rubbish.  he's only -- what? you look the same to me, sir. yes, sir. my word. sir, i thought one couldn't apparate within hogwarts. we need to get you up to the hospital, sir, to madam pomfrey -- all right.  okay. sir, are you... praying? do you think he would've done it. draco? no.  he was lowering his wand.  in the end, it was snape.  it was always snape.  and i did nothing... yeah, strange.  only... it's not. it's a fake. go on.  open it. dunno.  but whoever they are, they have the real horcrux.  which means, it was a waste.  all of it. i'm not coming back, hermione. i have to finish what dumbledore started. i'm not sure where that will lead me... but i'll let you and ron konw where i am -- when i can. yeah.  i do.  but do me a favor. when i'm around?  keep the snogging to a minimum. funny, he says the same about you. you're brilliant.  you both are. i don't know. i never realised how beautiful this place was. it's there, isn't it? sir! you should've let me, sir. we couldn't, perhaps, just try a summoning charm, sir? accio horcrux! sir... have you ever taken felix felicis? professor... there are bodies in this lake. do you think the horcrux is in there, sir? why can't i drink it, sir? professor? professor?  can you hear me? you... you can't stop, professor. you've got to keep drinking.  like you said.  remember. it will, sir.  it'll stop.  but only if you drink... what? no... one more.  just one more.  and then -- i promise... i'll do what you say. i promise. you did it, sir.  look -- i'm trying, sir.  i'm -- don't worry, sir.  we're nearly there. hermione, is the room of requirement unplottable? it would explain why i thought malfoy was leaving the castle when he disappeared off the map. he was going to the room of requirement. but i'm telling you.  i saw it -- what if there are two?  vanishing cabinets. i don't know... i don't need luck.  i'll be with dumbledore. i know who i am, hermione, alright? if dumbledore's traveling places, it's news to the ministry.  but get this:  that night at borgin & burkes?  it seems draco was looking at a vanishing cabinet. you tell me. who could tell the difference? she was cursed, wasn't she?  i know katie.  off the quidditch pitch she wouldn't hurt a fly.  if she was bringing that to someone, she wasn't doing it knowingly. it was malfoy. i... just... know. have you? i just thought, you know, since neither one of us can take who we'd really like... maybe we'd go together.  as friends. so who are you taking? really...? but i am the chosen one. okay.  kidding.  i'll just ask someone i like.  someone cool. who's up for a butterbeer? no.  over here. no, no.  sit next to me. hello, sir.  wonderful to see you. so what brings you here, sir? i'd consider it an honor, sir. dumbledore asked me to... get to know him. dunno.  but it must be important. otherwise dumbledore wouldn't ask. there's no time! the library. and? good.  that settles it then. the room of requirement... who showed you this?  first. sorry, sir.  i should've announced myself.  cleared my throat. coughed.  you probably feared i was madam sprout. just the general behavior, sir. the sneaking around.  the jumping when you saw me.  by the way, those tentacula leaves -- they're quite valuable, aren't they? personally, these plants have always kind of freaked me out. through the front doors, sir.  i'm off to hagrid's, you see.  he's a very dear friend and i felt like paying him a visit.  so if you don't mind, i'll be going. sir? well, then by all means come along, sir. don't you see, it was a ceremony. an initiation. it's happened.  he's one of them. so what's he doing in borgin and burke's?  browsing for furniture? look.  his father's a death eater. it only makes sense.  besides, hermione saw it.  with her own eyes. i need some air. luna.  how'd you...? sorry i made you miss the carriages, luna. i am your friend, luna. professor flitwick, you've known me for five years. have you ever fixed one?  a nose. what the hell.  give it a go. well?  how do i look? brilliant. positive.  why? i'd worked that much out for myself, funnily enough. lovely. i'll take your word for it. so what happens?  if you break an unbreakable vow? amazing. peruvian instant darkness powder? reckon he's right... good.  bad.  speaking of which... dunno.  let's get closer. i don't know.  i'm turned around. what just happened? sectumsempra! i think i can help you out with that... -.. harry appears. and i'm afraid it's rather extensive. how dare you stand where he stood. tell them how it was that night. tell then how you looked him in the eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. tell them! i'm a gryffindor. time. as much as you can give me. is that possible, professor? i think you're right. you, too, professor. give me something! quickly! a flask! anything. i know where he is. sir, this, is this... i mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren't you, sir? then... i'm dead too? not? but i didn't defend myself. i let him kill me. it's true, isn't it, sir? a bit of him lives in me, doesn't it? and you knew this? that's why you were certain i wouldn't die? professor, is that -- ? exactly where are we, sir? it looks like king's cross station -- only a lot cleaner. and without the trains. sir, why didn't you just tell me about the deathly hallows? sir -- you wanted to see ariana again, didn't you, sir? i used the stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when i entered the forest. i saw my mum and dad, and sirius and lupin... i've got to go back, haven't i? i've got a choice? and where would it take me? voldemort's got the elder wand. and the snake lives. and i've nothing to kill it with. with all due respect, sir, i think what we need here is a miracle. which would be, sir? sir, my mother's patronus. it was a doe, wasn't it? just like professor snape's. curious, don't you think? professor. is this real? or has this been happening inside my head? together? there's nothing scary about thestrals. they're gentle things. anyway, you won't be going up to school in the carriages. you/'be going in the boats, remember? yes? albus severus potter. you were named after two headmasters of hogwarts. one of them was a slytherin. and he was probably the bravest man i ever knew. then slytherin house will have gained a wonderful wizard. but listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose gryffindor. the sorting hat takes your choice into account. really. ready? okay. but take this. that way you can find me when you get back. ravenclaw common room. got to start somewhere. hermione nods, slips the map in her beaded bag and she and ron head off. just before they turn the corner, ron looks back, holds harry's glance briefly... and then is ginny! neville! you alright? luna -- ? confringo! the snake! we've got to kill the snake! because i have something worth living for. confringo! you were right. when you told professor snape it was failing you. it will always fail you. together. i told you: it's useless to you. because it answers to another. when he killed snape, he thought the wand would become his. but the thing is... it never belonged to snape. it answers to me. well, it wasn't boring, was it? why are you here? all of you? does it hurt? dying? i'm sorry. i didn't want any of you to die for me. and remus, your son... you'll stay with me? he won't be able to see you? stay close to me. you weren't. i'm going there now. it's... meant to be. there's a reason i can... hear them -- the horcruxes. i think i've known for awhile. kill the snake. kill the snake and then it's just him. then it will be over. it's you... expecto patronum! you're aberforth. dumbledore's brother. it's you i've been seeing -- here. it's he's dead. dung had no right selling you that. it belonged to -- we need to get into hogwarts. dumbledore gave us a job to do. we've been hunting horcruxes. we think the last one's in the school. but we'll need your help getting in. if we can find it and kill it, then we kill him, and then we can end this war once and for all. we need to get into hogwarts tonight. dumbledore trusted me, to see this through. why should he... i only care about the dumbledore i knew. i trusted him. i had no reason not to -- you're drunk. where've you sent her? neville, you look... the carrows? okay. there's something we need to find, something hidden here in the castle. it could help us defeat you-know-who. we don't know. i realize it's not much to go on. i think it might have something to do with ravenclaw. it would be small, easy to conceal, valuable. any ideas? hey there. ron smiles, about to speak, then notices ginny's eyes have not left harry. he frowns, speaks to hermione. i could ask you the same. i remember. what's wrong with the one you have? why didn't you tell her? bellatrix. you knew it was me. but you didn't say anything. no. i don't think so... besides, its allegiance is to me now. if you want it, you'll have to win it back. perhaps even kill me... expelliarmus! well done. let's find ron and get out of here. split up! no, it''ll just follow us! here! take one! wait! what about malfoy and blaise! ron, you once asked me if i thought he felt it -- voldemort -- when we destroy a horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul. he does. it's the snake. she's the last one. the last horcrux. no. he'll keep her close. c'mon. let's do it. imperio. how long before they come after us? what is that, griphook? griphook! what is that! well done. hey. lumos ! that's it. up there. give me the sword! the real one. we have a deal, griphook. griphook! griphook! come on! we're dropping! he knows. i saw him. i can't always help it, hermione! he's angry. but he's scared too. he's going to make sure the other horcruxes are safe. i reckon he'll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. there's more: one of them's at hogwarts. honestly, hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? we plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose. we'll go to hogsmeade. to honeydukes. take the secret passage in the cellar. there's something wrong with him. in the past, i could always follow his thoughts. now everything feels disconnected. no. it's more like he's wounded. if anything, he feels more i need to talk to the goblin. how are you? you probably don't remember -- yes. why did you leave gringotts? alone, yes. with you, no. it's complicated. why did bellatrix lestrange think it should be in her vault at gringotts? the sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. we didn't steal it. and she never suspected? and in madam lestrange's vault as well? then what? the goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes she was terrified when she thought we'd been in there. she kept asking you what else we'd taken. i'd bet anything there's a horcrux there. if we find it, we can kill it. and if we kill it, we're one step closer to killing him. i'm still working on that part. mr. ollivander, i need to ask you a few questions. can you identify these, sir? and this? was? isn't it still? what do you know about the deathly hallows, sir? but you, sir? do you believe they exist? you're lying. you know one exists and you told him about it. you told him about the elder wand and where to go looking for it. he has found it, sir. that's all, sir. we'll leave you to get some rest now. then i guess i'll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir. i reckon you should take this then. if i can hold it, you can. i'll know. i can't explain. it's like... no. i just know. when one's near. in the morning. he'll be leaving too. yeah. funny. listen, luna, about your father, i don't want you to think i -- hogwarts? it's not the place you left, you wouldn't know you if i didn't know you. sirius gave it to me. he had a matching piece. he said if i ever needed him, all i had to do was look into it. something like that. i don't know. he died before i ever got to use it. the thing is... you'll think i'm mental, but more than once, when i've looked into it -- i think i've seen dumbledore. you can give that to hermione to hold, all right, griphook? i'm a bit preoccupied right now, luna. we'll talk later, luna. later. okay, luna. who've you got in mind? you're the grey lady, the ghost of ravenclaw tower. i'm sorry. it's helena, isn't it? helena ravenclaw. rowena's daughter. luna told me. yes. she thought you might be able to help me. yes! that's right -- wait! please! but i don't care about its powers! honestly -- i don't seek it for myself! you have to believe me! i want to destroy it. that's what you want, isn't it, helena? you want it destroyed. i'll end your pain, helena. tell me where it is and i'll destroy it, i swear, on my mother's memory -- tom riddle -- he's lied to many people -- thank you... -.. then turning... thank you... -.. then running.",13970
Helena Ravenclaw,"i do not answer to that name. are you a friend of luna's? you seek my mother's diadem. luna is kind. unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. i cannot help you. many have sought my mother's diadem. its powers are but i only wanted to be more like her, clever and wise. she wore it so beautifully, but on me... i grew to hate it... the pain i felt... the pain i feel even now... another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with a strange name... but he lied. i know what he's done! i know who he is! he defiled it! with dark magic! strange... you remind me of him a bit... it's here. in the castle. in the if you have to ask, you'll never know. if you know, you need only ask...",143
Hermione Granger,"it's not real, the ceiling. it's just bewitched to look like the night sky. i read about it in hogwarts: a history. oh, no. okay, relax. nearly headless? how can you be nearly headless? we're tied with slytherin! i've read about those. when the smoke turns red,  it means you've forgotten something. ron's right, harry. you're gonna need your strength today. blood? but why would anyone go near that dog? so you're saying... bit early for mail, isn't it? come on, harry. feels strange to be going home, doesn't it? i've always heard hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but i found that rather enjoyable. it's happened before. what is it? and with dumbledore gone uh...we were just... now what do we do? neville, i'm really, really sorry about this... petrificus totalus. that's totally barbaric! see you haven't. good, you can help harry, then. he's going to go and look in the library for information on nicholas flamel. not in the restricted section. happy christmas. you mean you-know-who's out there, right now, in the forest? hang on a minute.  we're forgetting one thing. who's the one wizard voldemort always feared? dumbledore. as long as dumbledore's around, harry, you're safe. as long as dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. help! help! ahhh! help! swish and flick! is it...dead? it's my fault, professor mcgonagall. i went looking for the troll. i'd read about them and thought i could handle it. but i was wrong. if harry and ron hadn't come and found me...i'd probably be dead. never better. up. up. up. up. harry, no way! you heard what madam hooch said! besides, you don't even know how to fly.  what an idiot. we know about the philosopher's stone! of course! there are other things defending the stone, aren't there? spells, enchantments. is that...a dragon? that thing has a name? hogwarts teacher or not, i know a spell when i see one. i've read all about them. you've got to keep eye contact and snape wasn't blinking. i don't know. it's snape! he's jinxing the broom! leave it to me. lacarnum inflamarae. whoo-hoo! you won't make a fool of yourself. it's in your blood. well, that's good, isn't it? he'll be with his own kind. harry! look at you playing with your cards. pathetic! we've got final exams coming up soon. all right, what are the three most crucial ingredients in a forgetfulness potion? and what, may i ask, do you plan to do if this comes up in the final exam? no, you won't! besides, according to professor mcgonagall, we're to be given special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. follow me! i had you looking in the wrong section! how could i be so stupid? i checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading. of course! here it is!  ""nicholas flamel is the only known maker of the philosopher's stone!"" honestly, don't you two read? ""the philosopher's stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. it will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the elixir of life, which will make the drinker immortal."" it means you'll never die. ""the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr. nicholas flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!"" that's what fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. that's what's under the trapdoor...the philosopher's stone! sorry. ow! you stood on my foot! alohomora. the harp. it stopped playing. the staircases change, remember? we're not supposed to be here. this is the 3rd floor. it's forbidden. oh, move over!  alohomora.  get in. standard book of spells, chapter 7. filch is gone. it was locked. you don't use your eyes, do you? didn't you see what it was standing on? it was standing on a trap door. which means it wasn't there by accident. it's guarding something. that's right. now, if you two don't mind, i'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed... or worse, expelled! stop moving, both of you. this is devil's snare. you have to relax. if you don't, it will only kill you faster. just relax! do what i say. trust me. are you okay? he's not relaxing, is he? we've got to do something! uh! i remember reading something in herbology. um devil's snare, devil's scare,  it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! that's it! devil's snare hates sunlight!  lumos solem! what is that? curious. i've never seen birds like these. what's this all about? ugh! what're we going to do? there must be 1000 keys up there! what's wrong, harry? i don't like this. i don't like this at all. now what do we do? what happens now? ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you? what is it? no, ron, you can't!  there must be another way! you'll be okay, harry. you're a great wizard, you really are. me? books and cleverness? there are more important things. friendship, and bravery. and harry, just be careful. has anyone seen a toad? a boy named neville's lost one. oh, are you doing magic? let's see then. are you sure that's a real spell? well, it's not very good, is it? of course i've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. for example...  oculus reparo.  that's better, isn't it? holy cricket, you're harry potter. i'm hermione granger...and you are...? pleasure. you two better change into your robes. i expect we'll be arriving soon.  you've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? just there. stop, stop, stop. you're going to take someone's eye out. besides, you're saying it wrong. it's levi-o-sa, not leviosar. wingardium leviosa. i told you he'd take it well. harry, your eyesight really is awful. well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt... remember what we said.  keep your eyes down.  don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.  act as normal as possible.  just do what you see everyone else doing. we do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves inside. and then... correct. completely, utterly, without question. mafalda hopkirk, assistant in the improper use of magic office. you're somebody.  be careful. muggles.  in their rightful place. you appear to be quite popular. i didn't. try finite incantatem.  of course if something's gone wrong with an atmospheric charm -- this is you. i don't like him being on his own down there. you really have horrible teeth, you know that. relashio! harry... they've seen you.  we've got to get out of here. shaftesbury avenue.  i used to come here to the theater with my mum and dad.  just popped into my head.  i don't know why... this way! we need to change. undetectable extension charm. always the tone of surprise. that'll be the books. ron's right.  cappuccino, please. too dangerous.  if voldemort's taken over the ministry, none of the old places are safe. i've had the essentials packed for days.  just in case. petrificus totalus! go. she doesn't argue. obliviate. maybe you still have the trace on you. we didn't celebrate your birthday, harry.  ginny and i -- we'd prepared a cake.  we were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding... right.  perspective. mad-eye's doing, i'd guess.  in case snape decided to come snooping. homenum revelio. it's a spell to reveal human presence. we're alone. harry!  harry! ron!  i've found him! harry, you can't just disappear. we thought -- it's from your mum.  to sirius. bathilda bagshot...? did she now? harry.  i can imagine why you'd want to go there, but... i don't think bathilda bagshot is going to know where voldemort hid his horcruxes. lovely. yes.  question is, did he actually destroy the real horcrux? maybe he knows. but was it here?  did you ever see it? ron!  ron! they have flesh memories. snitches.  they're never touched by bare skin until the seeker captures it.  even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves.  that way, if there's a dispute, the snitch can identify who first touched it. when scrimgeour first gave it to you, i thought it might open at your touch -- that dumbledore had hidden something in it. expelliarmus! stop lying! you've still got it. really? we were friendly, not close like harry, but -- to harry!  it belongs to harry! it chose him!  it came to him in the chamber of secrets when he most needed it! where is your guard, sir? ron!  ron! coming, mum. obliviate. goodbye. harry, quickly, in my bag, there's a small bottle labeled 'essence of dittany.' quickly! unstopper it. just do it! we were.  we were there.  but yaxley had hold of me.  i knew we couldn't stay once he'd seen, so when he let go i brought us here. ron got splinched.  i'm... sorry. it's all i feel safe doing. salvio hexia... protego totalum... protective enchantments.  i don't fancy another visit like we had on shaftesbury avenue, do you? especially with ron like this. you can get going on the tent... repello muggletum... muffliato... how're the mushrooms?  seem to be the only edible things growing round here. make sure to leave some for ron. he'll be alright in a few days. hopefully.  if we could take him to hogwarts, to madam pomfrey -- so where do we go next? it scares me a bit, that, thinking it's a piece of vol-- dinner? tea? i hate it.  it's like he's here with us. incendio! confringo! what're you doing? i can put it in my bag -- i thought it had stopped. you can't let him in, harry. dumbledore himself said it.  you have to close your mind.  it's too dangerous -- tell me. what you saw. the wandmaker? viktor got his wand from gregorovitch.  most durmstrang students did at one time.  what's he got to do with you-know-who? don't -- it... comforts him. i think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.  it gets him through the day. we've all made sacrifices, harry. i don't know.  it takes time.  i'm doing all i can. take it off. take it off.  now. better? it's cold.  even though it's been lying against your skin for days. we'll take turns.  okay? he could smell it.  my perfume. i told you.  ron's not strong enough to apparate. no one can conjure food out of thin air.  food is the first of the five principal exceptions to gamp's law.  the other four are -- good plan. none of us do. i don't like this place. i want to go. i'll tell you in a minute. alright.  the sword of gryffindor? it's goblin made. you don't understand.  dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. it only takes in that which makes it stronger. harry.  you already destroyed one horcrux, right?  tom riddle's diary -- in the chamber of secrets. don't you see!  in the chamber of secrets, you stabbed the basilisk with the sword of gryffindor. its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom. exactly!  which means... which is why dumbledore left it to you in his will. actually, i'm highly logical, which allows me to look past the extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook. ron... take it off, ron.  please take it off.  you wouldn't be talking like this if you hadn't been wearing it all day -- harry, we weren't -- i didn't!  not like that!  harry -- i didn't! stop!  stop! me? what?  ron, no -- please -- he's gone. it's a muggle station. 'i open at the close?' i don't know.  but look, i've found something as well... i thought it was a picture of an eye, but now i don't think it is. it isn't a rune and it's not in spellman's syllabary either.  and it's been inked in -- somebody drew it -- it isn't part of the book. what d'you mean -- wearing it? why would someone have drawn it in a children's book? and it's exactly where you-know- who will expect you to go. because it means something to you. it's dangerous, harry.  but i have to admit, recently even i've been thinking we might have to go.  i think it's possible something else is hidden there. the sword.  if dumbledore didn't want it falling into the ministry's hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of gryffindor himself? harry, did you ever even open a history of magic? don't ever let me give you a haircut again. i still think we should've used polyjuice potion. harry, i think it's christmas eve! listen... yeah. i think they would. harry. no.  but look. did you know he had a sister? lumos. ignotus... hey, har -- happy christmas, harry. harry... someone's watching us.  by the gate. i don't think this is a good idea. muggles who've just been laying flowers on your parents' grave. omigod.  harry... harry, i'm not sure about this. there's something odd about her. and what's that smell? you have a lovely house, miss bagshot. all right... why? harry... harry! confringo! harry... harry, can you hear me...? good.  that's good... yes. i'm fine.  but you've been sick. rest... rest a bit more... the forest of dean.  i came here once with my mum and dad, years ago.  it's just how i remember it. the trees.  the river.  it's like nothing's changed.  not true, of course.  everything's changed.  if i brought my parents here, they wouldn't recognize any of it.  not the trees.  not the river.  not... me. wendell and monica wilkens now reside happily in sydney, australia.  they have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily.  no children. maybe we should just stay here, harry.  grow old. you wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was.  well, i know. it was in bathilda's sitting room. rita skeeter had sent it to her. harry, it doesn't make for very nice reading -- yes. for a time. gellert grindelwald.  he's not very well known in britain, but there was a time, before you-know- who... when grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from durmstrang. he'd started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. a few teachers had always protected him, but they couldn't anymore.  after he left, he traveled for awhile, then ended up in godric's hollow where his great aunt lived, bathilda bagshot. she introduced him to dumbledore. it made sense.  dumbledore's mother had just died, grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant -- they'd never really had anyone they could talk to on the same level.  they did a lot of talking that summer.  but they always returned to one particular subject. wizard rule over muggles. yes. it was something dumbledore came up with.  he believed wizards were superior and should rule over muggles, but gently, for their own good.  grindelwald took a more violent position. it was a different time, harry. it was one summer.  dumbledore was young -- he changed, harry.  years later, it was dumbledore who put grindelwald in prison. it's my fault.  as we were leaving godric's hollow, i cast a curse and it rebounded... i'm sorry, harry, i tried to mend it but wands are different -- maybe we can -- he loved you, harry.  i know he loved you. who could look at you beside harry potter?  what are you, compared with the chosen one...? who wouldn't prefer him, what woman would take you, you are nothing, nothing, nothing to him... everything all right? you -- complete -- arse -- ronald -- weasley!  you crawl back here after all these weeks and say, 'hey?' where's my wand?  harry, where's my wand! harry potter, you give me my wand! never mind why he's got my wand -- what is that? you destroyed it? don't think this changes anything. see me doing what things? what happened out there? and what may i ask did i say? what's going on in there? we need to talk. i want to go and see xenophilius lovegood. see this?  it's a letter dumbledore wrote to grindelwald. look at the signature.  it's the mark again. it keeps cropping up.  here.  in beedle the bard.  in the graveyard in godric's hollow -- what? where? harry, you don't have a clue where the next horcrux is.  and neither do i.  but this, this means something.  i'm sure of it. i'm always mad at him. what're you saying? stop it! penelope clearwater.  half-blood. a stinging jinx. not long. luna. do you see that? no!  don't go near it! it's an erumpent horn.  it's a class b tradeable material. where is luna, sir? the what? yes. it's in here. granger.  well... all right. there were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight -- in time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass... mr. lovegood, does the peverell family have anything to do with the deathly hallows? it's obvious, isn't it? the cloak. its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered. why the stone, harry? but according to the story they don't want to come back.  it's all rubbish anyway.  there's no such thing as the deathly hallows. there have always been cloaks -- mr. lovegood.  thank you, sir -- no matter, sir.  we really ought to be go-- ron!  harry!  take my hand! i didn't take anything. please. i didn't take anything. please! please! thanks, sir nicholas! it's good to be back! congratulations! i can't believe you solved it! thanks. oh, no! do you think he's all right? oh! harry! voice? what voice? harry, wait! not so fast! the chamber of secrets has been opened enemies the heir beware.' it's written in blood. that's why ron and i went looking for him, professor. we'd just found him when he said it's a bit strange, isn't it? you hear this voice, a voice only you can hear, and then mrs. norris turns up petrified. it's just strange. no, harry. even in the wizarding world, hearing voices isn't a good sign. it had to be a gryffindor. nobody else knows our password- unless it wasn't a student. you can talk to snakes. no, they can't. it's not a very common gift, harry. this is bad. i don't know, harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake on, or something. harry, listen to me. there's a reason the symbol of slytherin house is a serpent. salazar slytherin was a parselmouth. he could talk to snakes, too. he lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be. you will be able to, won't you? are you okay? no! even with a proper wand it's too risky. you could hit harry! let's go. finite incantatem! he called me a mudblood. it means dirty blood.â mudblood's a really foul name for someone who is muggle-born. someone with non-magic parents. someone like me. it's not a term one usually hears in civilized conversation. get off me! immobulus! yes. couldn't you tell? mcgonagall's worried. all the teachers are. the heir of slytherin has returned to hogwarts. the question is, who is it? if you're talking about malfoy. i heard him. but malfoy, the heir of slytherin? even they aren't that thick. but there might be another way. mind you, it would be difficult. not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty school rules. and, it'll be dangerous. very dangerous. it can't be hagrid. it just can't be. look. hagrid's our friend. why don't we just go and ask him about it? no! at least no one on the gryffindor team had to buy their way in. they got it on pure talent. you okay, ron? say something! professor, i was wondering if you could tell us aboutthe chamber of secrets? muggle-borns. professor? what exactly does legend tell us lies within the chamber? here it is. 'the polyjuice potion.'  'properly brewed, the polyjuice potion allows the drinker to transform himself temporarily into the physical form of another.' yes. exactly. but it's tricky. i've never seen a more complicated potion. a month. i know. but it's the only plan we've got. harry! hagrid! oh, it's so good to see you! what did you do to your glasses? oculus reparo. ok! bye! come on! everyone's been so worried. fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself. mandrake, or mandragora, is used to return those who have been petrified to their original state. it's also quite dangerous. the mandrake's cry is fatal to anyone who hears it. again? you mean the chamber of secrets has been opened before? maybe. we'll have to wait for the polyjuice potion to know for sure. heh no. no one ever comes in here. moaning myrtle. moaning myrtle. she's a little sensitive. everything's set. we just need a bit of who you're changing into. we also need to make sure that the real crabbe and goyle can't burst in on us while we're interrogating malfoy. i've got it all worked out. i filled these with a simple sleeping draught. simple, but powerful. now, once they're asleep hide them in the broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their uniforms. i've already got mine. millicent bulstrodeâ slytherin- i got this off her robes. i'm going to go check on the polyjuice potion. make sure that crabbe and goyle find these. we'll have exactly one hour before we change back into ourselves add the hairs. cheers! me too. i- i don't think i'm going. you go on without me! just go. you're wasting time! go away! do you remember me telling you that the polyjuice potion was only for human transformations? it was cat's hair i plucked off millicent bulstrode's robes. look at my face. of course. that's why he knew to give you the chocolate, harry. just forget it. yeah but i heard draco's father's furious. we haven't heard the end of this. dufftown? that's not far from here. this came with it. how fast is it, harry? it's not funny, ron. how are you feeling? umm... no one blames you, harry. the dementors aren't supposed to come inside the grounds. dumbledore's furious. as soon as he saved you, he sent them off. what? listen harry, they've captured sirius. any minute the dementors are going to perform the kiss. no. it's worse. much worse. they're going to suck out his soul. headmaster, you've got to stop them. they've got the wrong man. the point is, we know the truth. please believe us. sorry, ron, but seeing as you can't walk... what's he talking about, harry? 7:30. where were we at 7:30? come on. and we can't be seen. i can't believe they're going to kill buckbeak. it's just too horrible. you! you foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! that felt good. we'll stay with you too, hagrid. i think that means you owe someone an apology. i meant me! i thought i just saw... never mind. of course. remember what dumbledore said? if we succeed, more than one innocent life could be spared. let's go. fudge has to see buckbeak before we steal him. otherwise, he'll think hagrid set him free. harry, you can't. yes, and you must! harry, you're in hagrid's hut now. if you just go bursting in, you'll think you've gone mad. awful things happen to wizards who meddle with time. we can't be seen. fudge is coming. and we aren't leaving? why aren't we leaving? sorry. we're coming out the back door. go! is that really what my hair looks like from the back? i thought i just saw... never mind. okay, go, harry. go! okay, buckbeak. come quickly. come with us now. come on. keep trying. come on. quickly. buckbeak. okay? quickly. hurry up. okay? hurry up now, buckbeak, okay? come on. come on, buckbeak. come and get the nice dead ferret. come on. it's here. come on, beaky. come on, buckbeak. come on. buckbeak. i think they're funny. just ignore him. hagrid! he has to be taken to the hospital. ron. ron! ron! you foul, loathsome, evil little cockroach! this is a time-turner, harry. mcgonagall gave it to me first term. this is how i've been getting to my lessons all year. yes. dumbledore obviously wanted us to return to this moment. clearly, something happened he wants us to change. thanks. malfoy's coming. that felt good. oh, honestly, ron. if you ask me, divination's a woolly discipline. now, ancient runes, that's a fascinating subject. a fair few. don't be silly ron. how could anyone be in two classes at once? broaden your minds. use your inner eye to see the future!. go, harry! go, harry! beautiful day. ronald has lost his rat. rubbish. well, maybe you should take better care of your pets! did not. didn't. how did it go, hagrid? the hearing? and then? harry? this is horrible. harry, listen to me. no one's coming. you're dying... both of you. harry! no. but i don't like flying...! bombarda! we have to go. we save sirius. no idea. look. it's lupin. and snape's coming. and now we wait. harry, you do realize what tree this is? ron! ron, wait! harry! duck! harry! oh, i'm sorry. where do you suppose this goes? you go, i'll stay. that looks really painful. i'm sure madam pomfrey will fix it in a heartbeat. harry! harry! wait! wait! professor? professor lupin? at least someone's enjoying himself. yeah? with a patronus. i heard snape telling dumbledore. according to him... only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. harry, but your dad's... dead. i know. i'm just telling you what i saw. here we come. that's great. harry! run! saving your life! yeah, i didn't think about that. run! that was so scary. no one knows. boggarts are shape-shifters. they take the shape of whatever a particular person fears the most. that's what makes them so... but sir, we just learned about red caps and hinkypunks. we're not meant to start that for weeks. please, sir. an animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. a werewolf has no choice. with each full moon, when he transforms, he no longer remembers who he is. he'd kill his best friend if he crossed his path. furthermore, the werewolf only responds to the call of its own kind. but harry isn't going to keep it. he's going to turn it over to professor mcgonagall. aren't you? oh, look who it is. madam rosmerta. ron fancies her. harry! so rude. ron, look! sorry, sorry. excuse me, excuse me, sorry. harry, what happened? it's a cat, ronald. what do you expect? it's in his nature. that's rich... coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush. crookshanks, just ignore the mean little boy. harry. you know the egyptians used to worship cats? good morning, mr. weasley. honestly, ron, it's not funny. harry was lucky not to be expelled. come on. everywhere else is full. professor r.j. lupin. it's on his suitcase, ronald. seems to be. why? but they'll catch black, won't they? i mean, everyone's looking for him. why are we stopping? we can't be there yet. ouch, ron. that was my foot. harry. harry, are you all right? no one was screaming, harry. oh, do you mind me trying? the grim, possibly. what a load of rubbish. me? i've been here all this time. we're in the shrieking shack, aren't we? ron. you're okay. the dog. where is it? if you want to kill harry, you'll have to kill us too! no! i trusted you! and all this time, you've been his friend. he's a werewolf! that's why he's been missing classes. since professor snape set the essay. you attacked a teacher! it's meant to be the most haunted building in britain. did i mention that? do you want to move a bit closer? hope you don't mean yourself! harry! harry! come on, let's go in to the feast. take your time, harry. we'll be here when you are. no, they couldn't have. the parchment we all signed was enchanted, like i said. no one can betray the d.a. without us knowing. she's hurt! harry, you'd better take her to professor grubby-plank. she'll know what to do. how do you know? how'd voldemort get into the ministry of magic without being seen? i mean, he and sirius are the two most wanted wizards in the world... it just seems so unlikely, harry! think, harry! voldemort knows you! he knows you'd rush off to save sirius. yes, they can, harry. before we do anything, we need to establish that sirius really isn't at headquarters. which means we'll need to break into umbridge's office. mind you, it's got to be really good! we'll also need to keep everyone away from her office. we'll probably only manage five minutes or so. break out your invisibility cloak, harry. what's that ? hey, harry. have you seen ron? i can't find him anywhere. he's been acting fishy all week. he's up to something. he's got to be taken to the hospital wing. that old hag! she's sick! harry, i really think you should tell-- hagrid's still not back yet. i hope he's all right. harry, you can't write to him! owls are being intercepted, it isn't safe. you think she's working for you- know-who? i suppose so. he could have her under the imperious curse, though it's unlikely. dumbledore'd know. i wanted to know something about your course aims. but surely the whole point of defense against the dark arts is practical application? no, but- but we've got o.w.l.s coming up! you expect us to do the spells with no practice? how can dumbledore let that horrible woman teach? and when we're taking our owl tests too! well, not us specifically, but definitely dumbledore and the order. good luck, harry. no! please, stop! we have to tell her, harry... we were trying to find professor dumbledore. we had to tell him... that it's ready. the weapon. well, let's try a few. there's no one here, harry. this isn't the right room. harry, i think we should leave. i don't think sirius is here. don't touch it, harry! stupify! colloportus! harry, they went the wrong way! silenco! stupify! that's got to be what surgis podmore was doing in the ministry when he was arrested. it makes perfect sense, ron. it's got to be something the ministry's been developing. something top secret. look at this. there's been a mass escape from azkaban. yes. harry! oh, harry! we've missed you! are you furious with us, i bet you are! come on, inside. sorry we haven't written, harry, but dumbledore made us promise not to. he was so angry when he heard. it was...scary... some of the order are following known death eaters, like lucious malfoy. the order of the phoenix. dumbledore started it last time to fight you-know-who. he only reorganized it after last term. they'll have to let you off, harry... you were defending would you like a hug? hagrid...we've been walking for a good hour. we won't let her! of course we'll help. hagrid, i thought none of them wanted to come! oh, why, hagrid? why? oh, yes. it's very well hidden. don't call them that! grawp, help us! i thought it worked out rather nicely. i'd imagine we should fly. there's nothing there, harry. i think that went well. and did you see cho, harry? well, she couldn't keep her eyes off you, could she?! there we are. come on, i'll explain in a minute. these are some people i mentioned my defense against the dark arts idea with. obviously, this will help us pass our o.w.l.s, but more importantly, it gives us the ability to protect ourselves from...lord voldemort. several people jump or wince in fear at the name. that's true, but i think we're drifting from the purpose-- well...anyway...uh, i think that in order to learn properly we'll need a teacher. so all in favor of taking lessons from harry? where are we going to meet? ok, good. i think we should put our names down, so we know who was here. honestly, ernie, do you think i'd just leave it lying around? besides, its enchanted. also, what should we call ourselves? we'll let you know when we're going harry, are you all right? i know something that could cheer you up. hagrid's back! harry, ron and i, we've been named house prefects! she hands harry a letter. what about you, harry? are you sure? i would have thought you would get one! i hope he's all right... alastor moody? the aura. go on harry. harry for goodness sake. look at this! i can't believe it she's done it again. miss granger a plain but ambitious girl seems to be developing a taste for famous wizards. her latest prey sources report is none other than the bulgarian bon-bon viktor krum. no word yet on how harry potter's taking this latest emotional blow. they're not for ginny they're for you! dress robes. hot isn't it? viktor's gone to get drinks. care to join us? what's got your wand in a knot? the enemy?? who was it wanting his autograph? besides, the whole point of the tournament is international magical cooperation, to make friends. how dare you! besides i can take care of myself. what? what? that's what you think? you know the solution then don't you. next time there's a ball pluck up the courage and ask me before somebody else does, and not as a last resort. where have you been? nevermind! off to bed both of you. ron you spoil everything! it might interest you to know that neville's already got someone. oh well spotted. i won't be going alone because believe it or not someone's asked me. and i said yes. it's not going to work. you see this? this is an age line. dumbledore drew it himself. so a genius like dumbledore couldn't possibly be fooled by something pathetically dimwitted such as an age potion. boys. what? no of course. she said yes?? pssst! harry? is that you? how are you feeling? ok? the key is to concentrate. after that you just have to... oh um.. sorry i'll just go. your wand harry! your wand! harry! are you alright? you must be freezing! personally i think you behaved admirably. next to last. we've already been through enough people why don't you just go and do it yourself? ughh. what do you want me to say again? ronald would like me to tell you that seamus told him that dean was told by parvati that hagrid was looking for you. uhhh... dean was told by parvati that... please don't ask me say it again. hagrid's looking for you. i'm not an owl! three sir. because they are unforgivable. use of any one of them will... stop it! can't you see it's bothering him, stop it! there's a reason those curses are unforgivable, and to perform them in a classroom. i mean did you see neville's face. neville? bye. no. everything's going to change now isn't it? promise you'll write this summer. both of you. harry will won't you? harry! are you alright? just now. you? wake up. wake up ronald! honestly. get dressed, and don't go back to sleep. come on ron! your mother says breakfast's ready. what?? harry, tell me again. the black lake, that's obvious. again obvious, though i must admit potentially problematic look harry, we can do this. the three of us can figure it out. but sir, the second task is only hours away and... harry you told me you'd figured the egg out weeks ago. the task is two days from now. i wouldn't know, we didn't actually talk about the tournament. actually we didn't really talk at all, viktor's more of a physical being. i just mean he's not particularly... mostly he watches me study. it's a bit annoying actually. you are trying to figure this egg out aren't you? i mean these tasks are supposed to test you, in the most brutal way they're almost cruel. and um, i'm scared for you. you got by the dragon mostly on nerve, i'm not sure it's going to be enough this time. this is horrible, how can the ministry not know who conjured it. isn't there any security or? it's hurting again isn't it, your scar. you know sirius will want to hear about this. what you saw at the world cup, and the dream. harry it's his mark. will.  you.  stop.  eating!  your best friend is missing! where've you been, harry?  and what happened to your face? what's happened to his hand? how was what? dead boring.  though i think harry enjoyed dessert. ol' sluggy's having a christmas do, you know.  and we're meant to bring someone... actually, i was going to ask you. really.  but seeing as you have such a distaste for the idea -- don't drink that, ron! you could be expelled for that. ron.  stop.  you're making it snow. um, well, she came to visit you in the hospital, you see, and you talked -- i don't believe it was a long conversation -- does, doesn't she?  and you say you don't remember a thing from that night?  not one thing? right.  boggled... that's katie.  that's katie bell. dead. did you actually expect you could just walk up to ol' sluggy and ask him to reveal his deepest, darkest secret?  honestly, harry, sometimes i think the daily prophet should call you the dim one. you're going to have to persuade him somehow.  and now, i'm afraid, you've made it a lot harder. that's... not possible.  no one can leave the castle these days. the map is wrong. well?  how do you feel? now remember.  slughorn usually eats early, takes a short walk and then returns to his office. what?  no, harry -- you've got to go see slughorn.  we have a plan -- no. he's vile. no i have not. and if you had a shred of self-respect you would turn that book in. i'd like to know just whose book that was.  let's take a look, shall we? why not? the binding is fragile? the who? for weeks you carry around this book, practically sleep with it... and you have no desire to find out who the half-blood prince is? ron seems to be enjoying himself. you shouldn't have done it, harry. that was different.  it was tryouts.  this was an actual match -- you didn't put it in? ron only thought you did? charms spell.  just practicing. how does it feel, harry?  when you see dean with ginny? i know, harry.  you're my best friend.  i see how you look at her. oppugno! i might ask you the same. i happen to be his... friend. he's been poisoned, you daft dimbo! and for the record, i've always found him interesting. oh shut up. granger, sir.  that one there is veritaserum.  and that would be polyjuice potion.  and that is amortentia! the most powerful love potion in the world. it's rumored to smell differently to each person, according to what attracts them.  for example, i smell freshly mown grass and new parchment and spearmint toothpaste -- liquid luck. how did you do that? no.  the instructions specifically say to cut. sh! my parents are dentists.  they tend to people's teeth. no.  though, a boy named robbie fenwick did bite my father once. needed ten stitches. look at her eyes.  they've been fighting again.  her and dean. nothing. hm?  oh, i've just escaped -- i mean, left cormac.  under the mistletoe. i thought it would annoy ron most. but he's a menace.  he's got more tentacles than a snarfalump plant. no thank you. on second thought -- maybe it'll keep cormac at bay.  oh no, here he comes! was that an owl i heard? really? harry! a few days ago.  though... for a bit, i wasn't sure i was coming. she's not alone.  even my parents -- and they're muggles -- know something bad is happening. there's been a lot of chatter lately.  that he's gotten... old. dumbledore. strange.  thinking this is a piece of voldemort's soul... 'to the dark lord.  i know i will be dead long before you read this but i want you to know that it was i who discovered your secret.  i have stolen the real horcrux and intend to destroy it as soon as i can.  i face death in the hope that when you meet your match, you will be mortal once more.  r.a.b.' ron's okay with it, you know.  you and ginny.  but if i were you, when he's around, i'd keep the snogging to a minimum. we reckoned -- ron and me. i've always admired your courage, harry, but sometimes... you're really thick. you don't honestly think you can find all those horcruxes by yourself, do you? you need us, harry. like that's going to happen. besides, he's barking. yes, but i'm exceptionally perceptive. do you think we'll ever... come back? harry.  it's time. if one wants it to be.  why? of course, and that explains the vanishing cabinet as well! what if there are? you have to realize who you are, harry. sorry. so tell me what arthur said. what would draco want with a vanishing cabinet? he looks different, don't you think?  draco.  almost... ill. excuse me, i have to go vomit. he's at perfect liberty to kiss whomever he likes.  i really couldn't care less.  was i under the impression that he and i would be attending slughorn's christmas party together?  yes.  of course, now, given the circumstances, i've had to make other arrangements. yes.  why? why didn't i think of that? um... it's a surprise.  besides, it's you we need to worry about. and you can't pick just anyone. see that girl over there.  that's romilda vane.  rumor has it she's trying to slip you a love potion. hey! she's only interested in you because she thinks you're the chosen one.  you know that, right? what've you got there, hagrid? stinksap?  you're not sick, are you? the aurors. i know they're here to protect us, but... somehow i don't feel any safer. three butterbeers.  splash of ginger in mine, please. oh, honestly, ronald.  they're just holding hands... and snogging. leave?  you can't be serious. so?  what if she looked over here and saw you snogging me?  would you expect her to get up and leave? be delighted, sir. what's up? i'll get someone -- well, i was curious.  so i went to and... nothing.  there's no reference to the half-blood prince anywhere. stop, harry, i know where you're going with this -- harry is under the impression that draco malfoy is now a death eater. i told you.  i don't know what i saw. where's harry? these are adorable. how is it fred and george are doing it?  half the alley's closed down. oh no.  look. but everyone got their wands from ollivander.  young.  old... sorry. i don't know. where is everyone? don't forget to give professor longbottom our best. unless we can destroy it. you were thinking. it's ron's idea. and it's brilliant. where are you going? there he is. he vanished. just now. i saw it. ron glances at map -- then: that's right. i did. brilliant. yes! i don't want you to say anything you wouldn't say if we weren't about to be killed by a giant snake! it'll just ruin it! what's the matter with her? can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. something my mum used to say. why didn't it work for him? the elder wand. we? where've you been? what is it, harry? what is it you i'll go with you. i/'ll -- they were ready for us. no, you'll give us away. i know. harry! i can see you! in here! do you hear much from the others? from the order? that's ariana, isn't it? your sister. she's beautiful. she died very young, didn't she. mr. dumbledore... thank you. did save our lives twice. kept an eye on us in that mirror. that doesn't seem like someone who's given up, does it? she's coming back! and she's got someone with her! how bad is it, neville? with snape as headmaster. they did that to you? but why? did you see where it went? the diadem! do we climb! c'mon! this way! someplace safe. he's right. i was being stupid. it looks like it's been down here forever. that's barbaric. i... lumos ! look. no wonder bellatrix thought it was real. it's hot! all eyes turn to the bowl, wobbling madly on the floor, when... it splits apart and begins to multiply. ron, your foot! how're we going to reach it? harry! behind you! in here! we can't just stand here! who's got an idea? i've got something. but it's mad. relashio! it doesn't realize it's free! no. of course not. i'm scared. not this. when? how is it you -- you let him in! harry, you can't -- what? you saw it? tonight? but we have to plan. we have to figure out what -- harry, are you thinking there's a horcrux in bellatrix's vault? positive. harry turns to the two wands on the table -- the ones he showed ollivander -- and extends the longest to hermione. but i hate that thing -- that's the wand that killed sirius! how can i hold it and not feel... it is, harry. did dumbledore ever say anything to you, something that might explain why -- it's perfect. thank you, fleur.",7634
Horace Slughorn,"hm?  oh.  yes... very proud. actually i had intended to give it as a gift myself. you, headmaster. i've always cherished my students. they're my life... now don't forget to look over the chapter on antidotes.  i'll be poisoning one of you next time we meet.  i'm joking!  off you go! don't forget your rattails, miss alys. ah! if it isn't the prince of potions himself!  to what do i owe the pleasure? ask away, my dear boy, ask away! yes?  and exactly what was this rare magic. i'm a potions professor, harry. perhaps your question would best be posed to professor snape. there can be no light without the dark.  and so it is with magic. myself, i have always strived to live within the light.  i suggest you do the same. dumbledore put you up to this. didn't he?  didn't he! damn it all! yes???!!!! oh.  potter.  it's you.  i'm afraid i'm busy at the moment -- what's the matter with wenby? ah.  very well.  bring him in. i'd have thought you could whip up a remedy for this in no time, harry -- an expert potioneer like you. hm.  perhaps you're right. yes, well, water under the bridge as they say, correct? i'll ask you not to use that name. with all due respect, dumbledore sometimes forgets that most of us do not possess powers so great that we can risk offending the most dangerous dark lord who ever lived. alright, m'boy!  bottoms up! a tonic for the nerves. and a bloody strong one at that. pick-me-up's what you need, m'boy. do us all good, i think.  i've got butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a dazzling oak-matured mead.  i had other intentions for this but given the circumstances... there we are, potter.  to life! i d-don't understand -- harry m'boy!  i was beginning to worry!  and i see we've brought someone with us... nonsense, we'll sort you out.  any friend of harry's is a friend of mine.  right then, books out -- not to worry.  you can get what you need from the cupboard. now, as i was saying, i've prepared a few concoctions this morning.  any ideas what these might be?  yes, miss...? one of my best friends is muggle- born.  she's the best in our year... now amortentia doesn't create actual love, of course.  that's impossible.  but it does cause a powerful infatuation or obsession. for that reason, it is probably the most dangerous potion in this room. ah yes... what you see before you, ladies and gentlemen, is a curious little potion known as felix felicis. but it is more commonly referred to as -- yes, miss granger.  desperately tricky to make.  disastrous should you get it wrong.  but brewed correctly, as this has been, it has remarkable powers.  one sip and you will find that all your endeavors succeed... at least until the effects wear off. because taken in excess it causes giddiness, recklessness and dangerous overconfidence. twice.  once when i was twenty- four.  once when i was fifty- seven.  two tablespoons taken at breakfast.  two perfect days... so.  this is what i offer each of you today.  one tiny vial of liquid luck... to the student who, in the hour that remains, manages to brew an acceptable draught of living death, the recipe for which can be found on page ten of your textbook. you should know that in all the years of my previous tenure at hogwarts, not once did a student brew a potion of sufficient quality to claim this prize.  in any event -- good luck. merlin's beard!  but it's perfect. so perfect i daresay one sip would kill us all!  your mother was a dab hand at potions, but this... my, my, what can't you do, m'boy? perhaps you will save us all in the end... here you are then, as promised. one bottle of felix felicis.  use it well. to hogwarts' best and brightest! so tell me, cormac.  see much of your uncle tiberius these days? well, be sure to give them both my best.  what about your uncle, belby?  working on anything new? for those of you who don't know, marcus' uncle invented the wolfsbane potion. and you, miss granger?  what is it your family does in the muggle world? fascinating.  and is that considered a dangerous profession? miss weasley!  come in, come in. no matter.  you'll be just in time for dessert.  that is -- if belby leaves you any. thank you, one and all, for a most stimulating evening.  we'll have to do it again. oh.  potter. ah, yes.  a most intriguing object.  the sands run in accordance to the quality of the conversation.  when it is stimulating, the sands run slow. when it is not... nonsense.  you have nothing to fear, m'boy.  as for some of your classmates, well, let's just say, they're unlikely to make the shelf. anyone who aspires to be anyone hopes to end up here.  then again... you are already someone aren't you, harry? your mother was modest too.  your father not so much.  as you can see, he did not make the shelf. mr. riddle had many teachers while here at hogwarts. of course.  it's only natural that you should want to know more.  i'm afraid i must disappoint you, harry.  when i first met young mr. riddle, he was simply a quiet, albeit brilliant, boy committed to becoming a first-rate wizard.  not unlike the others i've known.  in fact, not unlike... you.  if the monster existed, it was buried deep within. someone has taken a bite out of it. thank you, adrian! one of mine.  class of '78.  i had hoped for more out of him, but at least the pictures are in focus. oh my!  excuse me, harry.  i must greet the new minister of magical transportation.  class of '67. mingle, m'boy!  mingle!  we're all friends here.  and we run the world. harry, i must insist you accompany me back to the castle immediately! and what makes you say that? merlin's beard... is that an actual acromantula? my god, dear man.  how did you ever manage to kill it? i'm sorry, i... didn't realize. hagrid.  i wouldn't want to be indelicate, but acromantula venom is uncommonly rare and, well, if you wouldn't mind my extracting a vial or two -- purely for academic pursuits... my thoughts exactly!  always carry a few spare ampoules for just such occasions.  old potion master's habit, you know... why don't i say a few words?  i trust he had family? farewell... farewell, aragog, king of arachnids.  though your body will decay, your spirit lingers on in the quiet, web-spun places of your forest home.  may your many-eyed descendents ever flourish and your human friends find solace for the loss they have sustained. and odo the hero, they bore him back home... sweet.  i once had a fish. francis.  lovely little thing. one day i came downstairs and he'd vanished.  poof. isn't it?  that's life, i suppose. one goes along and then... poof. that's never unicorn hair, hagrid? hagrid looks up, reels a bit.  nods. but my dear chap, do you know how much that's worth? it was a student who gave me francis.  one spring afternoon i discovered a bowl upon my desk with a few inches of clear water. there was a flower petal floating upon the surface.  as i watched, the petal sank, but just before it touched bottom... it transformed. into a wee fish.  it was beautiful magic, wondrous to behold.  the petal had come from a lily. your mother.  the day i came downstairs, the day i found the bowl empty... was the day she... i know what you want.  but i can't give it to you.  it will ruin me... please don't say his -- don't think too badly of me once you've seen it.  you don't know what he was like... even then. now, tom, i couldn't tell you if i knew, could i?  i must say, m'boy, i'd like to know where you get your information.  more knowledgeable than half the staff, you are. by the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? good gracious, look at the time. off you go, boys, or professor dippett will have us all in detention.  lestrange, avery, don't forget your essays... look sharp, tom.  you don't want to be caught out of bed after hours... yes, i imagine you do.  something on your mind, tom? go on. i don't know anything about such things and i wouldn't tell you if i did!  now get out of here at once and don't ever let me catch you mentioning it again! now, tom, i couldn't tell you if i knew, could i?  i must say, m'boy, i'd like to know where you get your information.  more knowledgable than half the staff, you are. by the way, thank you for the pineapple -- you're quite right, it is my favorite -- how is it you knew? good gracious, is it that time already?  off you go, boys, or professor dippett will have us all in detention.  lestrange, avery, don't forget your essays... look sharp, tom.  you don't want to be caught out of bed after hours... yes, i imagine you do.  something on your mind, tom? go on. excuse me? i'm not sure what you were reading, tom, but that's very dark stuff, very dark indeed. a horcrux is an object in which a person has concealed part of their soul. one splits one's soul and hides part of it in an object.  by doing so, you are protected should you be attacked and your body destroyed. that part of your soul that was hidden, lives on.  in other words, you cannot die. i think you can guess the answer to that, tom. yes.  killing rips the soul apart. it is a violation against nature. after, one is never the same. seven!  merlin's beard, tom! isn't it bad enough to think of killing one person?  to rip the soul into seven pieces... this is all hypothetical, isn't it, tom?  all academic... merlin's beard! there's no need to disfigure me, albus! it's all in the upholstery. i come by the stuffing naturally. what gave me away? yes, well, i couldn't very well use wizard's blood, could i?  oho! s-someone else?  i'm sure i don't know what you mean. oh all right!  the death eaters have been trying to recruit me for over a year.  do you know what that's like?  one can only say no to these people so many times before they... i never stay anywhere more than a week.  the muggles who own this place are in the canary islands. don't think i don't know why you're here, albus!  the answer is still no!  absolutely, unequivocally no! you look very like your father. except for your eyes.  you've got -- lily.  lovely lily.  she was exceedingly bright -- your mother. even more impressive when one considers she was muggle-born. oh, but you mustn't think i'm prejudiced!  no, no, no! your mother was one of my absolute favorites!  look, there she is. right up front. all mine, each and every one.  ex- students, i mean.  you recognize barnubas cuffe, of course, editor of the daily prophet. always takes my owl should i want to register my opinion on the news of the day.  and there's ambrosius flume of honeydukes.  sends a hamper of chocolate to the house each birthday.  that is, when i had a house.  and gwenog jones, captain of the holyhead harpies -- free tickets whenever i want them. of course, i haven't been to a match in some time... ah yes.  regulus black.  you no doubt know of his older brother sirius.  died a few weeks ago.  i taught the whole black family except sirius.  shame.  talented boy.  i got regulus when he came along, of course, but i'd have liked the set. of course.  but you're not leaving? all right!  i'll do it.  but i'll be wanting professor merrythought's old office, not that water closet i had formerly. and i expect a raise!  these are mad times we live in!  mad! filius!  i was hoping to find you at the three broomsticks. harry, m'boy! oh, the three broomsticks and i go way back.  longer than i'd care to admit.  in fact, i remember when it was simply one broomstick! oops!  all hands on deck, granger! listen, m'boy.  in the old days, i used to throw together the occasional supper and invite a select student or two.  would you be game? you'd be welcome too, granger. brilliant.  look for my owl. good to see you, wallenby. merlin's beard, harry! well, yes, actually -- why would you think that? ten galleons a leaf to the right buyer -- not that i'm familiar with such back alley transactions. one hears rumors is all.  my own interests are purely academic, of course. exactly how did you get out of the castle, harry? harry! it's nearly nightfall.  surely you realize i can't allow you to roam the grounds all by yourself.",2194
Howler,"what should we do with him, big d? what?",9
Igor Karkaroff,"albus! it's a sign severus, you know what it means as well as i. you seem to have given this a fair bit of thought mad-eye. i do sir. i have names sir. there was a rosier, evan rosier. dead? i didn't know. no! no! there was rookwood, he was a spy. ya ya, the same. he passed information to you know who from inside the ministry itself. no! wait! please! i have more. snape, severus snape. it's a lie! severus snape remains faithful to the dark lord. oh no no no no no. i heard about one more. the name... i know for a fact this person took part in the capture, and by means of the cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer frank longbottom and... barty crouch! ... junior.",131
James Potter,"this should cheer you up, sirius. look. sirius grins. all right, there, snivellus? impedimenta! and now, the moment you've all been waiting for-- another charity case, lily? nothing. it's more the fact that he exists, you see... levicorpus! i will if you go out with me. don't make me hex you, lily. fine! you're lucky lily was here, snivellus! apologize to her! now! i would never call you that. lily! hey lily! harry when the connection is broken you must get to the portkey. we can delay it for a moment to give you time but only a moment, do you understand? you're nearly there, son. until the end.",109

Kingsley Shacklebolt,"you're more important. the last words albus dumbledore spoke to the pair of us? what gave you away? the ministry has fallen.  the minister of magic is dead.  they are coming... there's the first signal. no one's going to die. mad-eye! you, tonks, and lupin take harry! we'll slow them down! they're gone, alastor. clear! tell professor mcgonagall remus and i will handle this side of the castle. dean! who said that?",72

Minerva McGonagall,"good evening, professor dumbledore. are the rumours true, albus? and the boy? do you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this? albus, do you really think it's safe, leaving him with these people? i've watched them all day. they're the worst sort of muggles imaginable. they really are... this boy will be famous. there won't be a child in our world who doesn't know his name. will you wait along here, please? now, before we begin, professor dumbledore would like to say a few words. when i call your name, you will come forth, i shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. hermione granger. draco malfoy. susan bones. ronald weasley. harry potter. your attention, please. i'm afraid professor dumbledore is not here. he received an urgent owl from the ministry of magic and left immediately for london. how do you know ? i don't know how you three found out about the stone, but i can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. now would you go back to your dormitories? quietly. oh! oh, my goodness! e-explain yourselves, both of you! miss granger? be that as it may be...it was an extremely foolish thing to do.  i would have expected more rational behavior on your part, miss granger. five points will be taken from gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment.  as for you two gentlemen i just hope you realize how fortunate you are. not many students could take on a fully grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. five points...will be awarded to each of you.  for sheer dumb luck. harry potter?  follow me. good evening. nothing, i repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken. each.  and to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention. no, you heard me correctly, mr. malfoy. you see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. you will serve detention with your classmates. you wait here. professor quirrell, excuse me, excuse me. could i borrow wood for a moment, please? potter, this is oliver wood. wood, i have found you a seeker! welcome to hogwarts. now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. but before you can take your seats, you must be sorted into your houses. they are gryffindor, hufflepuff, ravenclaw, and slytherin. now while you're here, your house will be like your family. your triumphs will earn you house points. any rule breaking, and you will lose points. at the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup. the sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. we're ready for you now. follow me. thank you for that assessment, mr. weasley. perhaps if i were to transfigure mr. potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, that way one of you might be on time. then perhaps a map? i trust you don't need one to find your seats. could i have your attention, please? oh! this is out of my hands, potter. all students are to return to their house dormitories at once. all teachers to the second floor corridor, immediately. as you can see, the heir of slytherin has left another message. our worst fear has been realized. a student has been taken by the monster into the chamber itself. the students must be sent home. i'm afraid this is the end of hogwarts. well, that's settled. we'll leave you to deal with the monster, gilderoy. your skills, after all, are a legend. ginny weasley. i think- do ya know- i think he's been petrified, madame pomfrey. look! perhaps he managed to take a picture of his attacker what can this mean, albus? what should i tell the staff. i warn you, this could be a wee bit of a shock. she was found near the library, along with this. does it mean anything to either of you? could i have your attention please? because of recent events, these new rules will be put into effect immediately. all students will return to their house common rooms by six o'clock every evening. all students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. no exceptions.â i should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it is likely the school will be closed. what are you talking about, mr. weasley? not today, mr. weasley. but, i must impress on both of you the seriousness of what you have done. i will be writing to your families tonight, and you will both receive detention. professor dumbledore will be waiting for you. sherbet lemon. this match has been cancelled. silence, wood. you and your teammates will go to gryffindor tower, now. potter, you and i will find mr. weasley. there's something the both of you have to see. could i have your attention, please? right. now, today, we will be transforming animals into water goblets. like so. one, two, three, vera verto. now it's your turn. well, who would like to go first? ah! mr. weasley. one, two, three. vera verto.â that wand needs replacing, mr. weasley. yes, miss granger? well, very well. well, you all know, of course, that hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches and wizards of the age: godric gryffindor, helga hufflepuff, rowena ravenclaw, and salazar slytherin. now, three of the founders coexisted quite harmoniously. one did not. salazar slytherin wished to be more selective about the students admitted to hogwarts. he believed magical learning should be kept within all-magic families. in other words, pure-bloods.â unable to sway the others, he decided to leave the school. now, according to legend, slytherin had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the chamber of secrets. though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own true heir returned to the school. the heir alone would be able to open the chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of all those who, in slytherin's view, were unworthy to study magic. well, naturally, the school had been searched many times. no such chamber has been found. well, the chamber is said to home to something that only the heir of slytherin can control. it is said to be the home of a monster. little lump of a boy. always trailing after sirius black. now remember, these visits to hogsmeade village are a privilege. should your behavior reflect poorly on the school in anyway that privilege shall not be extended again. no permission form signed, no visiting the village. that's the rule, potter. i can't. only a parent or a guardian can sign. since i am neither, it would be inappropriate. i'm sorry, potter. that's my final word. cornelius! professor dumbledore does not want dementors around the place, i can assure you. well. now years ago, when harry potter's parents realized they were marked for death... you remember? they went into hiding. few knew where they were. one who did was sirius black. and he told you-know-who! yes, little lump of a boy. always trailing after sirius black. well peter pettigrew tried to warn the potters... and might have managed to, had he not run into an old friend, sirius black. yes. sirius black may not have put his hands to the potters, but he's the reason they're dead. mhmm. this: sirius black was... and remains to this day... harry potter's godfather! potter! where on earth are you going at this time of night? what? yes, i think you might be right, potter. she looks at harry. well, give her to me. i'll run her there you are. bear in mind, potter, that channels of communication in and out of hogwarts are being watched, won't you? good. now, off to bed. potter! wake up, potter. wake up. please... you dreamed this, potter? you're sure this happened, potter? we're going to see the headmaster, potter. well, potter has had some kind of nightmare... yes, we're fine. good. off you go. my office. now. in all my thirty-nine years at this school, i have never seen such a disgusting display. of course he wanted to provoke you! he'd just lost! i cannot express in words the disappointment i feel right now. what is it, dolores? you thought wrong. now kindly remove yourself from my office. now, i don't care what malfoy said. your performance out there was shameful. fifty points from gryffindor, and i'm giving you both a week's worth of detentions. my hands are tied, potter. here you are potter. are you and miss patil ready? to dance. it's traditional that the three champions or in this case four are the first to dance. surely i told you that. oh well now you know. oh, as for your mr weasly you may proceed into the great hall with miss patil. this can't go on albus. first the dark mark, now this? put an end to it. don't let potter compete. well the devil with barty and his rules. and since when did you accomodate them... do nothing?? offer him up as bait? potter is a boy not a piece of meat. professor moody what are you doing? is that a student? we never use transfigration as a punishment, surely dumbledore told you that. well you will do well to remember it. the yule ball has been a tradition of the tri-wizard tournament since its inception. on christmas eve night we and our guests gather in the great hall for well mannered frivolity. as representitives of the host school i expect each and every one of you to put your best foot forward, and i mean this literally because the yule ball is first and foremost... a dance. silence. the house of godrick griffindore has commanded the respect of the wizard world for nearly ten centuries. i will not have you in the course of a single evening besmirching that name by behaving like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons. now to dance is to let the body breathe, inside every girl a secret swan slumbers longing to burst forth and take flight. inside every boy a lordly lion prepared to prance. mr weasly, will you join me. now, place your right hand on my waist. my waist. now bend your arm. mr filch... one two three, one two three, one two three. everybody come together. boys, on your feet. history of magic is up, ladies, not down.  mr. davies -- that's the girl's toilet... potter! enjoying ourself, are we? so i noticed.  i would think you'd want to fill it with potions.  or is it no longer your ambition to become an auror? and so you did when professor snape was teaching potions. however, professor slughorn is perfectly happy to accept n.e.w.t. students with 'exceeds expectations.' good.  and take weasley with you. he looks far too happy over there. i think we all agree that mr. potter's actions were heroic.  the question is:  why were they necessary. potter. potter, in light of what's happened... should you feel the need to talk to someone... you should know... professor dumbledore... you meant a great deal to him. to your houses.  no dawdling. you're sure katie did not have this in her possession when she entered the three broomsticks, leanne? did she say to whom? all right, leanne.  you may go. why is it always you three?  hm? when something happens? severus. is this it? yes.  she was cursed. that's a very serious accusation, potter. i suggest you return to your dormitory.  all of you.",1962

'harry is the best hope we have. trust him.' mad-eye reckoned you-know-who would expect the real harry to be with the most skilled auror.  he knew he'd be in the most danger. better. we want you to be the godfather. say yes. harry!  go!  go! professor! harry, are you alright? oh, i seriously doubt it, severus. it looks as though it's merely a parchment designed to insult anyone... who tries to read it. i suspect it's a zonko product. nevertheless, i shall investigate any hidden qualities it may possess. it is, after all, as you say, my area of expertise. harry, would you come with me, please? professor, good night. i'm sorry to hear about your broomstick. is there no chance of fixing it? listen. dementors are amongst the foulest creatures to walk this earth. they feed on every good feeling, every happy memory... until a person is left with absolutely nothing but his worst experiences. you are not weak, harry. the dementors affect you most because there are true horrors in your past. horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. you have nothing to be ashamed of. well i'd consider you a fool if you weren't. there was only one that night. i don't pretend to be an expert, harry. but as the dementors seem to have developed a particular interest in you... perhaps i should teach you. but after the holidays. for now, i need to rest. immobulus! get away from her! come in. i haven't the faintest idea how this map came to be in your possession... but quite frankly, i am astounded that you didn't hand it in. did it never occur to you that this, in the hands of sirius black... is a map to you? your father never set much store by the rules either. but he and your mother gave their lives to save yours. gambling their sacrifice by wandering around the castle unprotected... with a killer on the loose seems to me a poor way to repay them! now, i will not cover up for you again, harry. do you hear me? i want you to return to your dormitory and stay there. and don't take any detours. if you do, i shall know. oh, really? and who might that be? that's not possible. harry. there you are. you came. are you sure about this, harry? you know this is very advanced magic well beyond the ordinary wizarding level. well, everything's prepared. now, the spell i'm going to try to teach you is called the patronus charm. did you ever hear of it? no? well... a patronus is a kind of positive force. for the wizard who conjures one... it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him. but in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory. not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory. can you do this? yes. very well. close your eyes. concentrate. explore your past. do you have a memory? allow it to fill you up. lose yourself within it. then speak the incantation, expecto patronum. very good. shall we? wand at the ready. here we go. come on. sit up. deep breaths. it's all right. i didn't expect you to do it the first time. that would have been remarkable. here, eat this. you'll feel better. oh, no, no, no. that was a boggart, harry. a boggart. the real thing would be worse. much, much worse. as a matter of interest, what were you thinking? which memory did you choose? that's not good enough. not nearly good enough. is it strong? then let's give it a try. you feel ready? yes! well done, harry. well done! yes. sit down. here. eat this, it helps. it really helps. and just so you know, harry... i think you'd have given your father a run for his money. and that... is saying something. intriguing, isn't it? would anyone like to venture a guess... as to what is inside? very good, mr. thomas. now, can anybody tell me what a boggart looks like? so terrifying, yes, yes, yes... luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a boggart. let's practice it now. without wands, please. after me. riddikulus! very good. a little louder and very clear. listen: riddikulus! very good. so much for the easy part. you see, the incantation alone is not enough. what really finishes a boggart is laughter. you need to force it to assume a shape you find truly amusing. let me explain. uh... neville, would you join me, please? come on, don't be shy. come on. come on. hello. neville, what frightens you most of all? sorry? professor snape. yes, frightens all. and i believe you live with your grandmother. no... it won't. i want you to picture her clothes. only her clothes, very clearly, in your mind. we don't need to hear. as long as you see it, we'll see it. now, when i open that wardrobe... here's what i want you to do. excuse me. imagine professor snape in your grandmother's clothes. can you do that? yes. wand at the ready. one, two, three. think, neville, think. wonderful, neville, wonderful! incredible! okay... to the back, neville. everyone, form a line! form a line! i want everyone to picture the thing they fear the very most... and turn it into something funny. next! ron! concentrate. face your fear. be brave! wand at the ready, ron, wand at the ready. yes! you see? very good, very good! marvelous! absolutely, very, very enjoyable! parvati! next! show us what you see. keep your nerve. steady. and next! step up, step up! wonderful, wonderful! here! riddikulus! right. sorry about that. that's enough for today. collect your books from the back. that's the end of the lesson. thank you! sorry! sorry, you can have too much of a good thing. hello, harry. i saw you coming. i've looked worse, believe me. no. no. i resigned, actually. well, it seems that somebody let slip the nature of my condition. this time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving and parents will not want... well, someone like me teaching their children. dumbledore has already... risked enough on my behalf. besides, people like me are... well, let's just say that i'm used to it by now. why do you look so miserable, harry? didn't make any difference? harry it made all the difference in the world. you have uncovered the truth. you saved an innocent man from a terrible fate. it made a great deal of difference. if i am proud of anything... it is of how much you have learned this year. now, since i am no longer your teacher... i feel no guilt whatsoever about giving this back to you. so now i'll say goodbye, harry. i feel sure we'll meet again sometime. until then... mischief managed. you want to know why i stopped you facing that boggart, yes? i would've thought it'd be obvious. i assumed it would take the shape of lord voldemort. i'm very impressed. that suggests what you fear the most is fear itself. this is very wise. dementors force us to relive our very worst memories. our pain becomes their power. the very first time i saw you, harry, i recognized you immediately. not by your scar, by your eyes. they're your mother, lily's. yes. oh, yes. i knew her. your mother was there for me at a time when no one else was. not only was she a singularly gifted witch... she was also an uncommonly kind woman. she had a way of seeing the beauty in others... even, and perhaps most especially, when that person could not see it in themselves. and your father, james, on the other hand... he... he had a certain, shall we say, talent for trouble. a talent, rumor has it, he passed on to you. you're more like them than you know, harry. in time, you'll come to see just how much. here, eat this. it'll help. it's all right. it's chocolate. it was a dementor. one of the guards of azkaban. it's gone now. it was searching the train for sirius black. if you'll excuse me, i need to have a little word with the driver. eat. you'll feel better. expelliarmus! well, well, sirius. looking rather ragged, aren't we? finally, the flesh reflects the madness within. i know. i understand. how long have you known? well, well, well, hermione. you really are the brightest witch of your age, i've ever met. wait! very well. kill him. but wait one more minute. harry has the right to know why. no, harry it wasn't him. somebody did betray your parents... but it was somebody who, until quite recently, i believed to be dead! severus don't be a fool. sirius be quiet. severus, please. he was at school with us. we thought he was our friend! no, he didn't. i thought so too, until you mentioned seeing pettigrew on the map! you sold james and lily to voldemort, didn't you? you should've realized, peter, that if voldemort didn't kill you, then we would! together! harry, this man... harry, douse the light. we're exposed here. we're your advanced guard, harry. dumbledore just sent us as soon as he heard about the attack. we're taking you to safety. we're just waiting for the all clear. you didn't think dumbledore'd let you wander around on your own, did you? harry, i don't believe you've met nymphadora tonks. tonks, would you go get harry's broom from the house? brooms. on your broom, harry. there's the second signal! there's the other one, alastor! harry, leave it to us! ""expecto patronum!' get harry to the safe house! easy for you to say. harry! harry!...he's gone...there's nothing you can do... harry, no! stay here, harry. get in, quick, harry. don't touch anything. we're doing our best, but it's proving to be...difficult. fudge likes being minister of magic. if it turns out that voldemort came back under his watch, he'll be sacked. but dumbledore is doing all he can. i'm sorry, harry, we can't say anything more. voldemort has chosen draco malfoy for a mission? has it occurred to you, harry, that snape was simply pretending to offer draco help so that he could find out what he's up to? it comes down to whether or not you trust dumbledore's judgement. he trusts snape.  therefore, i do. you're blinded by hatred. you are!  people are disappearing, harry.  daily.  we can only put our trust in a handful of people. if we start fighting amongst ourselves, we're doomed. there's someone out there.  i can smell him.  there's more than one -- it's the quality of one's conviction that determines success, not the number of one's followers. me. speaking of quality. you shouldn't have. it's teddy who needs you. and he will want it to be quick. others will tell him what his mother and father died for. someday he'll understand...",1902

we've got to play our way across the room. all right. harry, you take the bishop's square. hermione, you'll be the queen's side castle. as for me, i'll be a knight. well, white moves first, and then...we play. you there! d-5!  yes, hermione, i think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess! castle to e-4! smash! ron: pawn to c-3! smash! boom! the queen turns, and smashes a piece! harry, ron and hermione wince. the queen turns again. both ron and harry study the game. you understand right, harry. once i make my move, the queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the king. do you want to stop snape or not? harry, it's you that has to go on. i know it. not me, not hermione, you.  knight...to h-3. check. ahhhh! excuse me, do you mind? everywhere else is full. i'm ron, by the way. ron weasley. so-so it's true? i mean, do you really have the...the... scar...? wicked. no, thanks, i'm all set. whoa! they mean every flavour! there's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. george sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once! it's just a spell. besides, it's the cards you want. each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. i got about 500 meself.  watch it!  oh, that's rotten luck. they've only got one good jump in them to begin with. i got about 6 of him. well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you?  this is scabbers, by the way, pathetic, isn't he? fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. want to see? ahem. sun- no. sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow! i'm...ron weasley. wingardrium leviosar! you do it then if you're so clever. go on, go on. never done that before, have we? i knew ginny was lying about that tattoo. right. so let's do it.  who gets who? the world's mental.  come on, drink up.  we've got a horcrux to find. in case you're interested, i'm reg cattermole, magical maintenance department. oh... yeah.  thanks. what do you reckon he meant by 'good luck.'? that's bloody disgusting. i gotta tell you, i'm starting to freak out a bit. they're not ministry.  they're snatchers.  they hunt muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price. really?  have you tried an umbrella? downstairs...? oh my god.  what am i going to do? my wife's all alone downstairs? no, that's mad.  you two find umbridge.  i'll be fine.  but how do i stop it raining? finite incantatem, okay.  and if that doesn't work...? m-morning. harry!  blimey, i forgot what you looked like.  where's hermione? bloody cold down here. what is it? 'tis, isn't it?  this'll be one to tell the kids. mary.  go home.  get the kids. i'll... i'll meet you there.  we have to get out the country, understand? mary!  do as i say! i'm sorry.  it's just -- long story.  nice meeting you. piss off. where are we? how the ruddy -- you're amazing, you are. they were after you, mate.  we'd just put everyone in danger going back. what she said. so where do we go from here?  the leaky cauldron? by the way -- these jeans?  not my favorite.  bit tight. this is dolohov.  i recognize him from the wanted posters. so what do we do with you, huh? kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you? suppose it's him that did mad-eye. how would you feel then? you're the boss. hermione? you're the best with spells. can't be. the trace breaks at seventeen. it's wizarding law. what? we've got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe. what was that about? good!  tell him from me he's a git! hey!  i think you two better come down here. the two clinging to the tree are death eaters for sure.  dunno 'bout the bloke on the bench. can't see us, of course.  but we'll have to be careful coming and going.  c'mon.  there's something else you need to see. r.a.b. was sirius' brother? kreacher... you're a thief, dung.  everyone knows it. wicked trainers. piece of advice.  let's not rehash old times.  got it... mate? no.  he's worried he should have got more money for it. hey ya -- well... thanks. always the tone of surprise. going somewhere? for you?  you think madeye died for you?  you think george took that curse for you?  you may be the chosen one, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. and leave hermione?  are you mad? we wouldn't last two days without her. don't tell her i said that. besides, you've still got the trace on you.  and there's the wedding... bill and fleur.  mum's been planning it for months.  only thing that's kept her sane, i reckon.  she'll kill me if i miss it.  kill you too.  rather go face to face with you-know-who if i'm honest. tonight's not the night, mate. you'd only be doing him a favor. do you think he knows? i mean, they're bits of his soul, the horcruxes.  bits of him.  when dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed tom riddle's diary all those years ago -- he must've felt something right? what i'm saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the horcruxes and begin to destroy them one by one... won't he know he's being hunted? dunno.  but something tells me he didn't come to give away the bride. dumbledore?  and me?  i dunno. i reckon i was just another weasley to him.  he was always polite -- dumbledore left this?  for me? brilliant.  er -- what is it? wicked. mum used to read me those!  the wizard and the hopping pot, babbitty rabbity and her cackling stump... oh, c'mon!  beedle's stories are famous!  babbity rabbitty? no...? what are those? c'mon.  mum's got dinner ready. no, don't!  don't say it! it's taboo -- you-know-who's name. that's how they track people now. it's how they found us in the cafe that night. i overheard a bloke from the enforcement office talking about it at the ministry.  blimey, what's that smell? not bloody likely.  smells like something ginny would cook. is that it? ... alive. it's angry. seems strange, mate.  dumbledore sends you off to find a load of horcruxes, but doesn't bother to tell you how to destroy them. doesn't that bother you? i'm hungry. leave it. mum can make food appear out of thin air. oh, speak english, can't you? i said leave it. yeah.  brilliant.  only, correct me if i'm wrong... wasn't that yesterday's plan?  and the day before that?  and the day before that?  walk.  sleep.  walk. sleep. he doesn't know what he's doing, does he? wizards were here. the sword was stolen. yeah, i'm still here.  but you two carry on.  don't let me spoil your fun. problem?  there's no problem.  not according to you, anyway. all right, i'll spit it out. don't expect me to skip up and down because now there's some other damn thing we've got to find. yeah, i thought i did too. no, i just reckoned after all this time, we'd have actually achieved something.  i reckoned you knew what you were doing.  i reckoned dumbledore had told you something worthwhile! i reckoned you had a plan! yeah, and we're about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them, aren't we! don't lie!  you said it, too, you said you were disappointed -- do you know why i listen to that radio, every night?  do you!  to make sure i don't hear ginny's name or fred or george or mum or -- and you? are you staying?  or coming? fine.  i get it.  i saw you two the other night.  yeah, that's right.  didn't know i knew, did you? are -- you -- mental? well, yeah.  bit obvious, i'd think. no.  i reckoned it was you. right.  antlers. no, i... i did think maybe i saw something -- when i was running -- over there -- anything? and we did, didn't we? what?  no.  harry.  that thing's bad for me.  i can't handle it. i'm not making excuses for how i acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you and hermione.  it made me think stuff -- stuff i was thinking anyway, but it made everything worse. no.  i can't -- i'm sorry.  i'm sorry i left. saving your life. and just think of it.  only three to go. hey. wo -- hey -- ouch! how come he's got your wand? no, of course not.  i only destroyed a bloody freaking horcrux!  why would that change anything!  do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming from you!  to see you doing those things -- look, i wanted to come back the minute i'd left.  i just... didn't know how to find you. with this. it doesn't just turn off lights. i don't know exactly how it works, but christmas morning i -- i was sleeping -- in this little pub-- i'd given some snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, i was sleeping when i heard it... a voice. your voice, hermione.  coming out of this. my name.  just my name.  like a whisper. so i took this and i clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.  and i knew. just knew.  on account of hermione's voice.  and sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through -- right here. i could feel it inside me.  it was warm, like the first sip of a good cup of tea.  and i knew it would take me where i needed to go. so i disapparated and came out on this hillside.  it was dark.  i didn't have any idea where i was. i just had to hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. and you did. i've always liked it.  these flames hermione makes. how long you reckon she'll stay mad at me? it was true.  every word. bloody hell.  i just realized. you need a wand, right? well, i've got one.  here.  it's blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special, but i reckon it'll do.  i took it off a snatcher a few weeks back. don't tell hermione, but they're a bit dim, snatchers.  this one was definitely part troll.  the smell off him... wo. nothing. maybe a bit more practice, eh? all right. but what does it mean? i think hermione's right.  i think we ought to go and see lovegood. what say we vote on it?  those in favor... sorry, harry.  looks like it's hermione and me this time. that treacherous old bleeder!  is there no one we can trust! i'll do the enchantments. don't touch her! stan shunpike. weasley... barney weasley. piss off!  arthur weasley's ten times the wizard you are! luna? keep off the dirigible plums. aren't you the one who keeps telling everyone it's their first duty to help harry? he's mental.  let's face it. luna's always good value, but she's nutty as squirrel poo. well, yeah, of course.  it's massive, isn't it? yeah, all right... the what? yes. midnight.  mum always said midnight. but twilight's fine.  better actually. let's get out of here once he's back.  i'm not touching this stuff, hot or cold. the wand. you're supposed to say the cloak, but who wants to spend all day being invisible.  dead boring if you ask me.  but an unbeatable wand! yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you'd lead. not like harry's.  i've seen a fair few.  dad used to bring home the ones the ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. they always got holes or tears. harry's is different.  it's perfect. you forgot the water. for the tea. nooooooooo! what are we gonna do? we can't leave hermione alone with her. we have to do something. let her go. works for me. shell cottage on the outskirts of tinworth. trust me. like hell. expellliarmus! rescuing you, of course. now, come on. get your trunk! you'd better stand back. let's go! come on. come on, harry! hurry up! i've got you harry! drive! uhh-um welcome back, hermione. huhh say it, i'm doomed. bloody bird's a menace. oh, no! who cares? hear what? kill? i don't like spiders what's that? are you mad? her skeleton will lie in the chamber forever.' ginny okay. what are you doing d- uh, i mean what are you doing down here? uhh who ever it was, they must have been looking for something. you're a parselmouth? why didn't you tell us? oh, that's what you said to it! i heard you speaking parseltongue. snake language? exactly! now the whole school's gonna think you're his great- greatgreat grandson, or something. hermione! but you heard mcgonagall! we're not allowed to leave the tower except for class. what's that? but if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no one's dead? and mrs. norris? i'm pretty sure she didn't have a camera or a mirror, harry. but how's a basilisk been getting around? a dirty great snake- someone would have seen it. pipes? it's using the plumbing! moaning myrtle. honestly, professor snape, i think it did more damage to us. we'll go and get our stuff, then. you're going to expel us, aren't you? i'll stop it. yes, sir. yes, sir. thanks, sir! that's dad's boss! cornelius fudge, minister of magic! hagrid's right! with dumbledore gone, there'll be an attack a day! it's disgusting. welcome home. it's not working! ahhhh! stop! stop! stop! huh aahh! ahh-ha-ha! my wand! look at my wand! what's happening? ahh! ahh! ahh! ahh! ahhhh! ahh! aaaahhhh! ahh! scabbers, you ok? the car! dad's gonna kill me. what do we do now? what about my sister?! you're the defense against the dark arts teacher! you can't go now! is there anything you can do? but harry's never traveled by floo powder before, mum. diagon alley! do you think it'd be all right if we had some of this? it's not much, but it's home. they were starving him, mum. there were bars on his window! ginny. she's been talking about you all summer. a bit annoying really. morning, dad. dad works in the ministry of magic, in the misuse of muggle artifacts office. dad loves muggles, thinks they're fascinating. oh, it he's always doing that. d'you think it's true? d'you think there really is a chamber of secrets? let's think. who do we know who thinks all muggle-borns are scum? of course. you heard him! 'you'll be next mudbloods,' crabbe and goyle must know. maybe we could trick them into telling. we don't even know this tom riddle. he sounds like a dirty, rotten snitch to me. that'll be a cheerful visit! hello, hagrid! tell us, have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle lately?â no! uh-oh. i smell trouble. those are nimbus two thousand and ones! how did you get those? you'll pay for that one, malfoy. eat slugs! whao! i don't know. the gateway's sealed its self for some reason. harry, if we can't get through, maybe mum and dad can't get back! the car what?! they're headed to the dark forest! why spiders! why couldn't it be follow the butterflies?â harry, i don't like this harry, i don't like this at all! can we go back now? harry. harry! ahh- hhh can we panic now? know any spells? where's hermione when you need her? whoah! glad we're out of there! ah- aaaah! thanks for that. aah! the flying gear's jammed! i'm trying! follow the spiders! follow the spiders! if hagrid ever gets out of azkaban, i'll kill him! i mean, what was the point of sending us in there? what have we found out? ahem. vera verto! three guesses who. do you mean, if harry and i drink that stuff, we'll turn into crabbe and goyle? wicked! malfoy'll tell us anything. mum fancies him. uh, right. okay. oh no! the invisibility booster must be faulty! okay. we can't be far behind. we must be gettin' close. aaahhh! aaahhhh! aaahhh! harry! hold on! take my hand! hold on! yeah. of course. don't you see? lucius malfoy must have opened it when he was at school here. and now he's taught draco how to do it. enlighten me. why are we brewing this potion in broad daylight, in the middle of a girl's lavatory? don't you think we'll get caught? why? who? who's moaning myrtle? how? whose hair are you ripping out then? ahem yeah. right. how thick could you get? ugh- essence of crabbe. i think i'm gonna be sick! uh harry? bloody hell! uh bloody hell. but where's hermione? that was close! look at your tail! have you spoken to hermione? yuck! but, it can't hurt if someone throws something at you. i mean, it'll just go right through you. say something. harry, say something in parseltongue! better you than us. aaah! ahemstomachache. s- scar. ugh! go on. what's this? bloody hell. whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! heart of a lion, this one. harry! harry! i'm fine! umron weasley. lockhart's memory charm backfired. he hasn't got a clue who he is! no! what'll do i do now? ok. shove off, malfoy. listen to the idiot. he's really laying it on thick, isn't he? who? stand back, i said! or i'll take it upstairs if you don't settle. quiet. let the man through. i didn't mean to open it, harry. it was badly wrapped. they made me do it. no one knows. . green. that's a monkey. what is that? you call that a monkey? do not give him one again. hey, neville, try an elephant. i will. oh, don't try one of them. oh, no. look at him. his face. honeyduke's sweetshop is brilliant, but nothing beats zonko's joke shop. we never did got a chance to go to the shrieking shack though. you heard it's the most... probably neville forgotten the password again. oh, you're there. serves her right. she was a terrible singer. spiders! there's... there's spiders. spiders. they want me to tap-dance. i don't wanna tap-dance! right, yeah. tell them. i'll tell them... he looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? well, you fell off your broom. there's something else you should know too. when you fell, your broom sort of blew into the whomping willow, and... well... it's scabbers who did it. he's my rat, sir. he's not really a rat. he was a rat. he was my brother percy's rat. but then they gave him an owl... what the bloody hell was that all about? how did you get there? i was talking to you there. and now you're there. it just got worse. hermione, no! he's not worth it. not good, brilliant! scabbers! you're alive! right. next time i see crookshanks, i'll let him know. let's go! oh, no. scabbers, you're alive! let's go. you're supposed to stroke it. hagrid, exactly what is that? that was wicked, harry! he bit me! scabbers! scabbers, come back! hermione, no! he's not worth it. not good, brilliant. you don't think that grim thing's got anything to do with sirius black? ancient runes? exactly how many classes are you taking? hang on. that's not possible. ancient runes is in the same time as divination. you have to be in two classes at once. gorgeous. unless of course you've been ripped to pieces! i haven't lost anything! your cat killed him! harry, you've seen the way that bloodthirsty beast of hers... is always lurking about. and scabbers is gone. your cat killed him! did. scabbers, you bit me! harry, hermione, run! it's the grim! harry! help! a bit? a bit? you almost tore my leg off! you better go. i'm fine. go. so painful. they might chop it. it's too late. it's ruined. it'll have to be chopped off. hermione! bad idea. bad idea. nice doggy. nice doggy! when did she get here? riddikulus! werewolves? when did she come in? did you see her come in? he's got a point, you know. those weasels! never told me about any marauder's map. sure. along with his invisibility cloak. that's not true! thick heads. i'm warning you, hermione. keep that bloody beast of yours away from scabbers, or i'll turn it into a tea cozy. a cat? is that what they told you? looks more like a pig with hair. harry. brilliant. loads of old stuff... like mummies, tombs, even scabbers enjoyed himself. along with the dung beetle. i haven't shown anyone. brilliant. i still think it was brilliant. who do you think that is? do you know everything? how is it she knows everything? oh. let me get this straight. sirius black has escaped from azkaban to come after you? sure. except no one's ever broken out of azkaban before... and he's a murderous, raving lunatic. what's going on? there's something moving out there. i think... someone's coming aboard. bloody hell! what's happening? well, you sort of went rigid. we thought maybe you were having a fit or something. no. i felt weird, though. like i'd never be cheerful again. she's gone mental, hermione has. i mean, not that she wasn't always mental... but now it's in the open for everyone to see. i'm not going back. see you. where did you come from? sure. oh, yeah. um... well, harry's got sort of a wonky cross. that's trials and suffering. and that there could be the sun and that's happiness. so... you're gonna suffer, but you're gonna be... happy about it. harry it's a trap. he's the dog. he's an animagus. harry! what did you just do? me?! he's mental! scabbers has been in my family for... so what? what are you trying to do to him? scabbers! leave him alone! get off him! what are you doing? twice. to the shrieking shack? actually, i'm fine here. shut your mouth, malfoy. what's up, malfoy? lost your skis? bloody hell, harry. that was not funny. good as new, mate. she can't! or somebody at the meeting could have blabbed to her. she doesn't look very good. you all right? to the department of mysteries? yeah. they can't just waltz into the ministry of magic! yeah ? get mcgonagall! go! harry! harry! harry! i tried out for quidditch keeper at the tryouts! i'm on the team! harry--bloody hell! you said she was making you do lines! always knew she was a bit fishy. you reckon she's here to spy on us? well, harry, shall we start on snape's report? what do you mean, people? harry, have you seen this? er...it's got your name on it. hiyya, harry. so you're saying this weapon you- know-who's after is in the department of mysteries? but why the department of mysteries? bloody hell! let him breathe, hermione! good to see you, mate. we wanted to, mate, we really did, but he thought they would get intercepted. there is an awkward silence. he thought you would be safest there. we've only seen him twice, and not for very long. he's really busy. it's not that fun, mate. mum won't let us anywhere near the meetings. we've already told you, we're not privyed to the meetings. but we do know a few things. what does he get a hug for? oh, sure, that's why. me? jealous? of course not, it just doesn't seem fair that you hug one friend more than the other, is all... no way. quidditch practice. if i don't show up, angelina'll go mad. shut up, malfoy! stupify! that's just what we were wondering. so, how do we get to the ministry? what are what? and what about those of us who can't see them? luna comes over to them. never again... ""the hog's head,"" hermione? not to mention you dueled with you- know-who all alone and he still couldn't kill you! i'm going to resign. i'm horrible! i should never have joined. this is the worst day of my life. come off it, hagrid! we're not blind! a month? so...no giants are coming? lockhart didn't teach as much as prune himself. come on, lets go back downstairs! what if he were still on his... what if he's still on his mission from dumbledore? blimey it's him, viktor krum! bloody hell, it's mad-eye moody. he was a catcher. half the cells in azkaban are full thanks to him. he's supposed to be mad as a hatter though these days. thank you nigel. not now nigel. later. go on. i told him i'd get him harry's autograph. oh look mum's sent me something. mum sent me a dress?? ginny these must be for you. what are you on about? dress robes? for what? bloody hell. what are those?? well they're alright. no lace, no dodgy little collar. traditional?? they're ancient! i look like my great aunt tessie. i smell like my great aunt tessie. murder me harry. poor kid, bet she's alone in her room crying her eyes out. hermione of course. come on harry, why'd you think she wouldn't tell us who she's coming with? because nobody asked her. i would have taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding proud. no. absolutely not. no, we'd not care to join you and viktor. he's a durmstrang. you're fraternising with the enemy. hrmph, i think he's got a bit more than friendship on his mind. no. he's using you. doubt it. he's way too old. yeah that is what i think. go on. well that's completely off the point. harry... they get scary when they get older. blimey harry, you slayed dragons. if you can't get a date who can? this is mad. at this rate we'll be the only ones in our year without dates. well, us and neville! now i'm really depressed. well hermione, you're a girl. come on. it's one thing for a bloke to show up alone. for a girl it's just sad. bloody hell. look. we've just got to grit our teeth and do it. tonight when we get back to the common room, we'll both have partners. agreed? eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't it? in three years from now we'll be old enough to be choosen. how did you do it? never mind. doesn't matter. you could have let your best friend know though. you know bloody well what. yeah that's me, ron weasley... harry potter's stupid friend. piss off. i reckon you'd have to be barking mad to put your own name in the goblet of fire. wasn't just me who thought you'd done it. everyone was saying it behind your back. at least i warned you about the dragons. oh no no, i did. don't you remember? i told hermione to tell you that seamus told me that parvati told dean that hagrid was looking for you. seamus never actually told me anything, so it was really me all along. i thought you'd be alright, you know, after you figured that out. yeah it is isn't it. suppose i was a bit distraught. there she was walking by. you know i like it when they walk. i couldn't help it, it just sort of slipped out. what else? i ran for it. i'm not cut out for this harry. i don't know what got into me. who you talking to? i heard voices. you're probably just practicing for your next interview i expect. well... yeah... a bit merci. blimey even when you go wrong it turns out right. we're still misfits. yes... well, my dad did tell me about one... the imperious curse. brilliant isn't he! completely demented of course. terrifying to be in the same room with, he's really been there you know. do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at hogwarts? well i won't. you know i won't! bloody hell. don't know. hey dad! where are we going? you think so? anything else? fine. something's about to burst out of hilary but i don't think it's a swan. where? packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand. on second thought, just the drewbals. just the drewbals, thanks. loads according to dad, that's what worried them so much. happened right under their noses. there's no one like krum. he's like a bird the way he rides the wind. he's more than an athlete, he's an artist. been looking for you for ages. thought we lost you. blimey dad, how far up are we? krum!!! don' you worry.  he'll be 'long soon 'nuff -- oi!  turn around, you lunatic. looks like his own this time. sorting hat urged us all to be brave and strong in these troubled times -- easy for it to say -- it's a hat, isn't it?  first years seemed to enjoy it, though. wankers. filch give you the wand outside? that was cheerful. but i don't want to take potions! so.  how was it? your dinner party. i expect you'll be going with mclaggen.  isn't he a member of the slug club? really? i'm resigning.  after today's match.  mclaggen can have my spot. sure... c'mon, harry.  we've got a game to win. huh? tell me again how i broke up with lavender? don't get me wrong.  i'm bloody thrilled to be shot of her.  it's just she seems... a bit put out. well... there is... something. but no.  it can't be.  besides, i was completely boggled, wasn't i? it's beautiful, isn't it?  the moon. it was on your bed.  the box. thought i'd try one... i can't stop thinking about her, harry. she could never annoy me.  i think... i think i love her. do you think she knows i exist? snogging?  who're you talking about? romilda, of course.  romilda vane. it's no joke!  i'm in love with her! no.  can you introduce me? what do you suppose dean sees in her?  ginny. dean?  he's brilliant. yeah, well, he was running his hands all over my sister, wasn't he?  something snaps.  you've got to hate him.  you know, on principle. so what is it?  he sees in her? attractive? skin?  you're saying dean's dating my sister because of her skin? hermione's got nice skin. wouldn't you say?  as skin goes, i mean. right. so.  did you and ginny do it? you know.  hide the book. still no luck with slughorn, i take it? no. have to admit, thought i was going to miss that last one.  hope cormac's not taking it too hard. has a bit of a thing for you, hermione.  cormac. not bloody likely.  he's top of the class.  even better than you, hermione.  slughorn thinks he's a genius. what? the who? what's with the birds? look, i can't help it if she's got her knickers in a twist.  what lav and i have -- well, let's just say there was no stopping it.  it's chemical.  will it last?  who knows?  point is, i'm a free agent. er... my... nee... er!  my!  nee! how do i look? where's romilda? hello, darling.  fancy a drink? what's this? what happened to me? i feel really... bad. these girls are gonna kill me, harry. ron weasley, sir.  but i'm dead awful at potions, a menace actually, so i probably should just be going -- hard feelings? really?  strapping guy like you, you've got a beater's build, don't you think?  keeper needs to be agile, quick -- harry?  did someone say harry? 'course not.  think i'd know if my best friend was in my room, wouldn't i? harry! you've a bit of... mum sort of lost it last week. said ginny and i had no business going back to hogwarts.  that it's too dangerous. anyway, dad stepped in, told her she was being barmy.  took a day or two, but she came round. a hundred and fifty.  give or take a few years. no.  i got an owl from dad this morning.  the one at borgin & burke's?  it's still there. good luck, mate. lav, c'mon. of course i'll wear it. believe me, professor, i've been asking myself the same question for six years. spider?  about six feet tall?  ten feet wide? barking.  does he not remember that raving arachnid tried to eat us? what? o-kay. aw, bloody hell... i'd like to leave. that happens to be my sister. what're you playing at? get to know him? um... you've got a little... bit worried about her.  did you hear that rubbish she was talking back in the pub?  her and me snogging.  ha.  as if... harry, she's swallowing her tongue -- yeah. right. well, it's true.  i like a nice chat before i go to bed.  now you're always reading that bloody book.  it's like being with hermione. the library. one of what? you're barking.  what would you- know-who want with a sod like malfoy? it's a creepy shop.  he's a creepy bloke. probably on the platform.  c'mon. unbreakable vow.  you're sure that's what snape said. it's just, well, you can't break an unbreakable vow. no, you don't understand -- oh, bloody hell... all she wants to do is snog me. my lips are getting chapped. look. you die. how much for this? how much for me? but i'm your brother! c'mon. let's go. hi. fred reckons people need a laugh these days. is it just me?  or do draco and mummy look like two people who don't want to be followed? what're they playing at? hey.  where's hermione? harry, where is she? bloody hell. he's gone. the snake too. never! do you hear me! never! harry, hermione and i have been thinking. it doesn't really matter if we find the horcrux. so we were thinking -- you destroyed tom riddle's diary with a basilisk fang, right? well, we know where we might find one, don't we? bloody hell. we/'ll never find him on this. brilliant. let's go. well done, malfoy! hermione! not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we? but that means... what do you reckon we should do with it? liar! he saved your life. we thought you'd gone to the forest, we thought you might be -- are you mad! no! rubbish! you can't just give yourself up to him -- hermione squeezes ron's arm, silencing him. what's he mean by that? did you get a look at him! fora second i thought it was -- who's that with her? bloody hell... i don't remember this being on the marauder's map. excuse me. but would someone tell me: what's a bloody diadem? six months she hasn't seen me and it's like i'm frankie first year. i mean, i'm only her brother. shut up, seamus. run! goyle's set the bioody place on fire! serves him right. brilliant. you're bloody well welcome! where will he take her? look inside him, harry. find out where he is. if we find him, we find the snake. then we're one step closer to ending this. hey. easy. what do you mean? harry, what do we do? harry...? what's that? up ahead. you don't say.  just out of interest... is there any other way out of here? imperio! no. it's not possible... bloody hell. that's a welsh green. it's been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise. lumos ! blimey... is it here, harry? can you feel anything? keep going! the cup! foul little git. least we've got bogrod. that's unfortunate. you're asking us? you're the brilliant one. that's your idea? harry talks in his sleep. haven't you noticed? i've never got this far before. me too. hermione: i didn't expect it to be like this. you do it. yes, you can. that was brilliant! brilliant! bloody hell. i say we jump! never mind! what did you see? what happens when he finds out four are gone? what? 'fraid he's right. one problem: snape's headmaster now. we can't just walk in the front door. maybe it's because of the horcruxes. maybe he's growing weaker. maybe he's dying. then you're on our side. who put it there? the fake. and if we find one? how're we supposed to destroy it if we've given griphook the sword? you're sure it's hers? you heard ollivander. it's harry's now. how will we know what it is when we get in there? after all, a horcrux can be anything. that's a bit scary. always good value. i'll miss her. what d'you think? you want to tell me what that is? you mean he could see you? go on. bloody hell... that's a sight. hideous. couldn't do anything about that bit in the back that's always flipping up, could you? dead annoying -- never mind. i'm good.  that is you in there, isn't it?",6916

malfoy, no... no! buckbeak! whoa, whoa, whoa... whoa! buckbeak! away, you silly creature! calm down! it's just a scratch! i'm the teacher. i'll do it. class dismissed! well, first off, the committee members took turns... talking about why we were there. and then i got up and did my piece. said how buckbeak... was a good hippogriff, always cleaned his feathers. and then lucius malfoy got up. well, you can imagine. he said buckbeak was a deadly and dangerous creature... who would kill you as soon as look at you. and then he asked for the worst, did old lucius. no, i'm not sacked. buckbeak's been sentenced to death! allow me, minister. sorry about that. its jus' up ahead, here. all righ'. well, i'm showin' yeh this, because tha' umbridge woman put me on probation. i can' last much longer afore i get sacked like trelawney. knew yeh'd say yes! okay, real quiet like from here on. there we are! none o' them did, hermione! i didn' have much ruddy choice inna matter! i couldn' leave 'im! he's me brother! well, half-brother anyway. me mum had 'im afore she died. here. i'll introduce yeh to grawp! yeh all righ', grawp?

you'll see soon enough. pay attention this is important. as a matter of fact i have. you might like to try the same thing now and again. oh, the cloak. put the cloak on. bonsoir olympe. couldn't forget you olympe. you'll be glad you came. trust me. come on harry. they're seriously misunderstood creatures. although, i have to admit that horntail is a right nasty piece of work. poor ron nearly fainted just seeing him you know. oh sure. his brother charlie helped bring him over from romania. didn't ron tell you that? 'arry.  'orace. kill 'im! me oldest friend, 'e was! ah, don' worry yerself.  yer not alone.  seriously misunderstood creatures -- spiders.  it's the eyes, i reckon.  unnerve people. i reckon that too... how'd yeh get outta the castle anyways? don' suppose it's doin' 'im any good, izzit? wish yeh coulda seen 'im in 'is prime.  magnificent 'e was.  jus' magnificent... aragog. tha' was... tha' was... beautiful. to the place he'd known as a lad, they laid him to rest with his hat inside out and his wand snapped in two, which was sad... i had 'im from an egg, yeh know. tiny little thing he was when he hatched.  no bigger'n a pekinese. tha's odd. no idea... no idea at all... take more'n tha' ter finish me off.  not sure about me 'ouse, tho'.  but if anybody can put it righ', dumbledore can. only thing i can't reckon is wha' snape was doin' with tha' lot. an' wha's this wi' the dark mar'? who's been killed? where's dumbledore, 'arry? where's dumbledore!! hey, you three! stinksap.  burn the whiskers right off yer chin.  trees 'ere are drippin' with it. it's not fer me.  it's fer aragog. yeh remember aragog, don' yeh? tha's the one.  he's taken ill. i'm hopin' ter nurse 'im back. keep yer fingers crossed. get back!  all o' yeh! now, now.  now, now... don' go touchin' tha' but by the wrappin's.  unnerstan'?",3473
Rufus Scrimgeour,"these are dark times, there is no denying.  our world has perhaps faced no greater threat than it does today.  but i say this to our citizenry:  we, ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would seek to take it from you. your ministry remains strong... i think we both know the answer to that question, mr. potter. don't be coy, mr. potter.  mr. weasley.  would you say you were close to your former headmaster? and you, miss granger?  how would you characterize your relationship? this.  despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to have been particularly close to their recently deceased headmaster, he saw fit to remember them in his will.  now why do you suppose that would be? come now, you don't expect me to believe... 'herein is set forth the last will and testament of albus percival wulfric brian dumbledore.  first, to ronald bilius weasley, i leave my deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most dark -- it will show him the light.' 'to miss hermione jean granger, i leave my copy of the tales of beedle the bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.' 'to harry james potter, i leave the snitch he caught in his first quidditch match at hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill. not quite.  dumbledore left you a second bequest:  the sword of godric gryffindor.  unfortunately, the sword of gryffindor was not dumbledore's to give away.  as an important historical artifact, it belongs... the sword may present itself to any worthy gryffindor, miss granger.  that does not make it that wizard's property.  and in any event the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown. the sword is missing. i won't pretend to be your friend, mr. potter.  but i assure you i'm not your enemy. dumbledore said something very similar the last time we spoke. i came alone.  i don't really need them anymore...",339
Scabior,"what's that?  that... smell? hello, beautiful. your boyfriend'll get worse than that if he doesn't behave, lovely. what happened to you, ugly? what's your name? check the list.  and you, ginger? like 'ell you are.  we know skinny stan.  try again. weasley, eh?  wouldn't be related to that blood traitor arthur weasley, would you? worth ten times you if i can find him.  wasn't you that tipped him off, was it? how 'bout you, lovely?  what do they call you...? you smell like vanilla, penelope. i think you're going to be my favorite. change of plans, boys.  we won't be taking this lot to the ministry. now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, i hope, mr. malfoy.",119

Severus Snape,"good luck today, potter. then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against slytherin. good afternoon. now, what would three young gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this? you want to be careful. people will think you're  up to something. there will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. as such, i don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. however, for those select few...  who possess the predisposition, i can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. i can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper...  in death.  then again, maybe some of you have come to hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.  mr. potter. our...new...celebrity. tell me, what would i get if i added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?  you don't know? well, let's try again. where, mr. potter, would you look if i asked you to find me a bezoar? and what is the difference between monkshood and wolfbane? pity. clearly, fame isn't everything...  is it, mr. potter? silence.  and put her hand down, you silly girl.  for your information, potter... asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful, it is known as the draught of living death. a bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. as for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.  well?  why aren't you all copying this down?  and gryffindors, note that five points, will be taken from your house... for your classmate's cheek. what? oh! you don't want me as your enemy, quirrell. you know perfectly well what i mean.  we'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie. it will happen saturday next.  at nightfall. -- from the source we discussed. this is a false trail.  the auror office no longer plays any part in the protection of harry potter. those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the ministry. to a safehouse.  likely the home of someone in the order.  i'm told it has been given every manner of protection possible. once there, it will be impractical to attack him.  we may have compromised the ministry, but there are those who remain loyal to him.  as long as the ministry stands, his allies within will have the means at their disposal to insure his safety. expelliarmus! perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block unfriendly spells, professor. weasley's wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. we'll be sending potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. might i suggest someone from my own house? malfoy, perhaps? don't move, potter. i'll get rid of it for you. vipera evanesca. if i might, headmaster? perhaps potter and his friends were simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. however, the circumstances are suspicious. i, for one, don't recall seeing potter at dinner. yes, miss granger? a girl has been snatched by the monster, lockhart. your moment has come, at last. weren't you saying just last night that you've known all along where the entrance to the chamber of secrets is? you were seen by no less than seven muggles. do you have any idea how serious this is? you have risked the exposure of our world. not to mention the damage you inflicted on a whomping willow that's been on these grounds since before you were born. silence! i assure you, that were you in slytherin, and your fate rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. as it is headmaster, these boys have flouted the decree for the restriction of underage wizardry. as such-- i've done the dungeons, headmaster. no sign of black, nor anywhere else in the castle. remarkable feat, don't you think? to enter hogwarts castle on one's own... completely undetected? any theories on how he managed it? you may recall... prior to the start of term i expressed concerns... about your appointment of professor... what about potter? should he be warned? potter. what are you doing wandering the corridors at night? how extraordinarily like your father you are, potter. he, too, was exceedingly arrogant, strutting about the castle. turn out your pockets. turn out your pockets! what's this? really? open it. reveal your secrets. read it. go on. why, you insolent little... well, well. lupin. out for a little walk... in the moonlight, are we? that remains to be seen. i have just now confiscated a rather curious artifact from mr. potter. take a look, lupin. supposed to be your area of expertise. clearly, it's full of dark magic. there you are, potter! come back here, potter! turn to page 394. that's not really your concern, is it, potter? suffice it to say your professor finds himself incapable of teaching... at the present time. turn to page 394. quiet. now, which one of you can tell me the difference... between an animagus and a werewolf? no one? how disappointing. thank you, mr. malfoy. that's the second time... you've spoken out of turn, miss granger. are you incapable of restraining yourself... or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? five points from gryffindor. as an antidote to your ignorance, and on my desk, by monday morning... two rolls of parchment on the werewolf, with emphasis... on recognizing it. then i suggest you take extra care, mr. potter. loss of limb will not excuse you. page 394. the term werewolf... is a contraction of the anglo-saxon word were... which means man, and wolf. werewolf, man-wolf. there are several ways to become a werewolf. they include being given the power of shape-shifting... being bitten by a werewolf... expelliarmus! vengeance is sweet. how i hoped i'd be the one to catch you. i told dumbledore you were helping an old friend into the castle, and now here's the proof. give me a reason. i beg you! oh listen to you two, quarreling like an old married couple. i could do it, you know. but why deny the dementors? they're so longing to see you. do i detect a flicker of fear? oh, yes. a dementor's kiss. one can only imagine what that must be like. it's said to be nearly unbearable to witness, but i'll do my best. after you. sit, potter. as you are well aware, i will be teaching you occlumency. the headmaster feels you should learn this form of magic to defend yourself against the dark lord, who is skilled at legilimency. legilimency is the ability to extract thoughts and feelings from others. as usual, you have all the subtlety of a stone wall, potter. the mind is not a book, of which any page can be examined. the mind is complex and multi-layered. yes, it did, but at the expense of our advantage. the connection between you was so powerful during your vision of the snake that the dark lord became aware of it. the headmaster fears that he may try to use this to his advantage, to manipulate you through false visions. wand out, potter. you may use any spell you can think of to try and repel me. i am going to break into your mind. well, you stopped me eventually. ideally, you should repel me with your mind. clear your mind, potter. abandon what was that? realized what, potter? what did you say? there are many things in the department of mysteries, potter, none of which concern you. have you been practicing, potter? well, we shall see, won't we? you just wait... semper--- i don't need help from a mud-blood like her! having fun, potter? been enjoying yourself? amusing man, your father... you will repeat what you saw to no you had better not, potter, or you will experience a pain so horrible you will wish you had never been born! now get out of my sight! do not set foot in this office ever again! you wished to see me? well, it appears that i cannot help you. i have none. potter, if i want nonsense shouted at me, i shall inform you. he sweeps from the office. umbridge is enraged. potter! what's your hurry? congratulations, your performance in the black lake was inspiring. gilliweed, am i correct? ingenious. a rather rare herb gilliweed, not something found in your every day garden. nor is this, know what it is? veritaserum. three drops of this and you-know-who himself will spill his darkest secrets. the use of this on a student is regrettably forbidden, however should you ever steal from my personal stores again, my hand might just slip over your morning pumpkin juice. don't lie to me. gilliweed might be innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing flies? you and your friends are brewing polyjuice potion and believe me i'm going to find out why. master i too find it difficult to believe this mere coincidence, if we are to truly discover the meaning of these events perhaps we should for the time being let them unfold. polyjuice potion. what's going on back here? you've just bought yourself a month's detention, mclaggen. not so quick, potter. ... can surely survive your absence for another minute or two. besides, i only wish to convey a message. from professor dumbledore.  he asked that i give you his best and that he hopes you enjoy your holiday.  you see, he's traveling and won't return until term resumes. i'll escort him out. i swore to protect you.  i made the unbreakable vow -- you're afraid, draco.  you attempt to conceal it, but it's obvious. let me assist you -- don't ever associate that word and my name again. no!  he belongs to the dark lord! you dare use my own spells against me, potter? you may have gotten your mother's eyes, but you're as dim as your father.  yes.  it's me.  i'm the half-blood prince. have you ever considered that you ask too much?  that you take too much for granted?  has it ever crossed your brilliant mind that i don't want to do this anymore? no!  the dark lord was clear.  the boy's to do it.  go on, draco. now! no. i gave my word.  i made a vow... avada kedavra! you can no longer stay here. go on! go on! what do you think? i think miss bell is lucky to be alive. indeed.  your evidence? you... just... know.  once again you astonish with your gifts, potter, gifts mere mortals could only dream of possessing.  how grand it must be to be the chosen one. it was his father's. it's alright, mr. filch.  i can vouch for mr. malfoy. run along, wormtail. if the dark lord has forbidden it, you ought not to speak. put it down, bella.  we mustn't touch what isn't ours. as it so happens i'm aware of your situation, narcissa. your sister doubts me, narcissa. understandable. over the years i have played my part well.  so well i've deceived one of the greatest wizards of all time. dumbledore is a great wizard. only a fool would question it. i can't change the dark lord's mind.  but it might be possible for me to help draco.  to provide some... protection. i can try. take out your wand. i will. i will. i will. many of you are surely wondering why i have summoned you here at this hour. it has come to my attention that earlier this evening... harry potter was sighted in hogsmeade. i mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by for myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little surprise. we have, for some time, considered mr. potter's return to hogwarts to be not only possible but inevitable. consequently, in the past several months and under my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat any attempt mr. potter might make to breach these walls. but know this. should anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid mr. potter, that person will be punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. rest assured: so long as i am headmaster at hogwarts, harry potter will never again step foot in this castle. now then. if anyone here has knowledge of mr. potter's movements this evening... i invite them to step forward now. lily... then... she's jealous. because she's ordinary and you're special. it's true. you know so yourself. no! don't kill me! yes. only what i heard. but now... he thinks it refers to her. yes! but he thinks it's her son! he intends to hunt them down now! to kill them! i have asked. she's more than that! she's different! beautiful. kind. anything. you said you would keep her safe! he doesn't need protection. the dark lord has gone -- no one can know. your word. he exhibits no measurable talent. his arrogance rivals even his father's. and he seems to relish his fame. you see what you want to see. why did you put it on? surely you realized it carried a curse. drink the rest. it will contain the curse to the hand for the time being. it will spread. maybe a year. it is not expected that he will succeed. you ask too much. tell him what? so when the time comes, the boy must die. you've kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. you've been raising him like a pig for slaughter. expecto patronum! always... we go to black... take them... take them! please. they are the same... you have your mother's eyes... you have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my lord. in the last few hours alone -- there is no wand more powerful. ollivander himself said it. tonight, when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, i am sure. it answers to you and you only. my lord? with you, of course, my lord. my lord --",2381

Sirius Black,"i'll be forever grateful for this... to both of you. one day, perhaps. for some time, my life will be too unpredictable. and besides... you're meant to be here. and you know it. and for now, that will do. i expect you're tired of hearing this... but you look so like your father. except your eyes. you have... it's cruel that i spent so much time with james and lily, and you so little. but know this: the ones that love us never really leave us. and you can always find them... in here. you really are the brightest witch of your age. sorry about the bite. i reckon that twinges a bit. i was going for the rat. normally, i have a very sweet disposition as a dog. in fact, more than once, james suggested that i make the change permanent. the tail i could live with. but the fleas, they're murder. it's beautiful, isn't it? i'll never forget the first time i walked through those doors. it'll be nice to do it again as a free man. that was a noble thing you did back there. he doesn't deserve it. i don't know if you know, harry... but when you were born, james and lily made me your godfather. i can understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and uncle... but if you ever wanted a different home... it's just a thought. i can understand if you don't want to. remus, my old friend! have you taken your potion tonight?

curiously long life for a common garden rat! he's missing a toe, isn't he? finger! that dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead! and then he transformed into a rat! how dare you speak to harry! how dare you talk about james in front of him! i would have died! i would have died, rather than betray my friends! i would rather die! put that away, james. i'm bored. wish it was full moon. expelliarmus! locomotor mortis! get out of here, you two! that will take you back out of the department of mysteries. you're the important one, now, harry. i have to help the order. i'll always be here for you, harry. now go! hello, cousin! is that the best you've got, cousin? shut up, you miserable old hag! quiet! mother, yes. dear old mum. right. well, the ministry is furious with you. you'll have to go to an disciplinary meeting tomorrow. you surprise me, harry. i figured the first thing you'd do is start asking about voldemort. he has a right to know, molly. i know what dumbledore said, but he needs to know something. he's not a child, molly. he's not your son. he's got me. he's like a son to me. what do you want to know, harry? he's hiding for the moment, because the ministry is ignoring his return and he doesn't want that to change. the last person you-know-who wanted to alert was dumbledore. he's building up his army again, just like before. you see, when the ministry of magic insists that voldemort isn't back. well, they think i'm a mass- murderer, lupin is a werewolf, tonks and arthur would lose their jobs at the ministry... you-know-who wants something. something he didn't have last time. a weapon. yeah, absolutely. harry! you all right, harry? harry, i've got something that might interest you. this was the original order of the phoenix. found it while we were cleaning. there's mad-eye and dumbledore, right next to dedalus diggle; marlene mckinnon, she was killed two weeks after this was taken...; then there's frank and alice longbottom, tortured into insanity by death eaters; lupin, of course.. i know, harry, i know. i miss them too. it's not fair that i got to spend so much time with them and you didn't... i know i'm not your father, harry, but i'll always be there for you, if i can help it... kreacher, get out of here! now! kreacher. he's been alone with the house for years, he's gone a bit funny. harry. i couldn't risk sending edward. it was since the world cup and the ministry's been intercepting more and more owls and she's too easily recognised. we need to talk harry. face to face. meet me in the griffindore common room at one o clock this saturday night and make sure you're alone. p.s.... the bird bites. i don't have much time harry so let me get straight to it. did you or did you not put your name into the goblet of fire? shh... i had to ask. now, tell me about this dream of yours. you mentioned wormtail and voldemort, but who was the third man in the room? you didn't hear a name? what was that? yes. it's just a dream. look harry, the deatheaters at the world cup, your name rising from that goblet these are not just coincidences. hogwarts isn't safe any more. i'm saying the devils are inside the walls. igor karkaroff, he was a deatheater. and no one, no one stops being a deatheater. then there's barty crouch, heart of stone, sent his own son to azkaban. i haven't a clue who put your name in that goblet harry but whoever did it is no friend to you. people die in this tournament. you don't have a choice. keep your friends close harry. quicker than falling asleep. no. we're here, you see.",1082

Tom Riddle,"professor dumbledore. yes, professor. i- i suppose i- i had to see for myself if the rumors were true. about the school, as well? i don't have a home to go to. they wouldn't really close hogwarts, would they professor? sir- if it all stopped- if the person responsible was caught-- no, sir. nothing. good night, sir. evening, hagrid. i'm going to have to turn you in, hagrid. i don't think you meant it to kill anyone, but-- the dead girl's parents will be here tomorrow. the least hogwarts can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered. monsters don't make good pets, hagrid. now, stand aside. stand aside, hagrid! cistem aperio! arania exumai! i can't let you go. they'll have your wand for this, hagrid. you'll be expelled. she won't wake. she's still alive, but only just. a memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years. it won't come until it's called. you won't be needing it. i'm afraid i can't do that, harry. you see, as poor ginny grows weaker, i grow stronger. yes harry, it was ginny weasley who opened the chamber of secrets. it was ginny who set the basilisk on the mudbloods and filch's cat, ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls. because i told her to. you'll find that i can be very persuasive. not that she knew what she was doing. she was, shall we say, in a kind of trance. still, the power of the diary began to scare her. and she tried to dispose of it in the girl's bathroom. and then, who should find it, but you? the very person i was most anxious to meet. i knew i had to talk to you, meet you if i could. so i decided to show you my capture of that brainless oaf, hagrid, to gain your trust. it was my word against hagrid's. only dumbledore seemed to think he was innocent. he certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. i knew it wouldn't be safe to open the chamber again while i was still at school, so i decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old self in its pages, so that one day i would be able to lead another to finish salazar slytherin's noble work. haven't i told you? killing mudbloods doesn't matter to me anymore. for many months now, my new target has been you. how is it that a baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest wizard of all time? how did you escape with nothing but a scar, while lord voldemort's powers were destroyed? voldemort is my past, present, and future. surely, you didn't think i was going to keep my filthy muggle father's name? no. i fashioned myself a new name, a name i knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when i became the greatest sorcerer in the world. dumbledore's been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of me! so, this is what dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird and an old hat. shearhas- samnathas- sã©lithaeine. let's match the power of lord voldemort, heir of salazar slytherin, against the famous harry potter. sethae- he- this. parseltongue won't save you now, potter. it only obeys me! no! your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still hear you! yes, potter, the process is nearly complete. in a few minutes ginny will be dead, and i will cease to be a memory. lord voldemort will return- very much alive! remarkable isn't it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk penetrates the body? i'd guess you have little more than a minute to live. you'll be with your dear mudblood mother soon, harry. funny, the damage a silly little book can do especially in the hands of a silly, little girl. what are you doing? stop! no! ahhhh! ahhhh! ahhhh! don't. you're the doctor, aren't you? i don't believe you.  i hear mrs. cole talking, her and the rest of the staff.  they want me looked at.  they think i'm different. i'm not mad. yes. i can make things move -- without touching them.  i can make animals do what i want without training them.  i can make bad things happen to people who are mean to me.  i can make them hurt... if i want. who are you? prove it. i like having things that belonged to other people.  it makes me feel ... close to them. i can speak to snakes too. they find me.  whisper things.  is that normal.  for someone like me? sir, is it true that professor merrythought is retiring?

are you burdened? you bring news i trust, severus? and this information comes -- pius, what say you? spoken like a true politician. you will, i think, prove most useful, pius.  where will he be taken?  the boy? wormtail!  have i not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet? as inspiring as i find your bloodlust, bellatrix, i must be the one to kill harry potter.  but i face an unfortunate complication.  it has recently come to my attention that my wand and potter's share the same core. they are, in some ways, twins.  we can wound but not fatally harm one another.  which means, if i am to kill him... i will have to do it with another's wand. come now.  surely one of you would like the honor?  what about... you, lucius? i require your wand. do i detect elm? and the core? my wand?  you can't possibly think i would give you my wand. for those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by miss charity burbage who until recently taught at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry.  her specialty was muggle studies. it is miss burbage's belief that muggles are not so different from us. she would, given her way, have us mate with them.  to her, the mixture of magical and muggle blood is not an abomination but something to be encouraged.  i, of course, take a contrary view.  but we're all civilized here.  all adults.  we can agree to disagree. avada kedavra! nagini... dinner. can you reach it? can you take it for me, black? oh, you will die. eventually. but there are hours, even days of pain awaiting you before then. i'm going to enjoy this, black. i have you, and soon i shall have the weapon. and then not even your pathetic order can stand in my way! voldemort laughs, a horrible spine-chilling laugh. it is you who made that mistake, dumbledore! avada kedavra! you do not seek to kill me, dumbledore? there is nothing worse than death! so, you smashed my prophesy... i grow tired of you continually thwarting my plans, harry potter! avada kadavra! bow to death, harry... let me see it again. ah yes, the time is close now. harry! at last! step aside wormtail so i can give our guest a proper greeting! no! kill the spare. do it, now! my wand wormtail. hold out your arm. the other arm wormtail. welcome my friends. thirty years it's been, and yet you stand before me as though it were only yesterday. i confess myself disappointed, not one of you tried to find me. not even you, lucius. there were signs my friend, and more than whispers. out of fear, not loyalty. still you have proved yourself useful these past few months wormtail. oh, such a handsome boy. harry! i'd almost forgotten you were here. standing on the bones of my father. i'd introduce you but word has it you're almost as famous as me these days. the boy who lived. how lies have fed your legend harry. shall i reveal what really happened that night thirteen years ago? shall i divulge how i truly lost my powers? it was love. you see when dear sweet lily potter gave her life for her only son she provided the ultimate protection. i could not touch you. it was old magic, something i should have forseen. but no matter, no matter. things have changed, i can touch you now! astonishing what a few drops of your blood will do eh harry? pick up your wand potter. i said pick it up, get up. get up! you've been taught how to duel i presume yes? first we bow to each other. come on now harry the niceties must be observed, dumbledore would not want you to forget your manners now would he? i said bow! that's better. and now... atta boy harry, your parents would be proud. especially your filthy mongrel mother. i'm going to kill you harry potter, i'm going to destroy you. after tonight no one will ever again question my powers. after tonight if they speak of you they'll speak only of how you begged for death, and i being a merciful lord obliged. get up. don't you turn your back on me harry potter i want you to look at me when i kill you, i want to see the lights leave your eyes. do nothing. he is mine to finish. he's mine! no! the boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it will be done exactly as i say. good. first, gather our old comrades. send them a sign. nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door. step aside so i can give our guest a proper greeting. i know that many of you will want to fight. some of you may even think this wise. but this is foily. i wish you no harm. ti have great respect for the students of hogwarts. i was once one myself after all. i ask for but one thing and if granted no magical blood shail be spiit... give me harry potter. do this and none shall be harmed. give me harry potter and i shail leave hogwarts untouched. give me harry potter and you will be rewarded. you have fought valiantly... but in vain. i do not wish this. every drop of magical bliood i therefore command my forces to retreat. in their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. treat your injured. stop looking at her. she smells your fear. it agitates her. be grateful she's just eaten. i do not need to seek the boy! before the night is out, he will come to me! do you understand! how do you live with yourself, lucius?  go. find severus. tell him i need to see him immediately. why doesn't it work for me? no! i am extraordinary! but the wand resists me! does it? the wand. does it truly answer to me? you're a clever man, severus. surely you must know. where, severus? where does its loyalty lie? the elder wand cannot serve me properly, severus, because i am the elder wand belongs to the wizard who killed its last owner. ollivander was quite explicit about that. you killed dumbledore, severus. while you live, the elder wand cannot be truly mine. you have been a good and faithful servant, severus. but only i can live forever... kill. nagini! come! behold, nagini. our work is done. well, i must say, i'd hoped for better. is this truly the best hogwarts has to offer? who might you be, young man? well, welcome, neville. i'm sure we can find a place for you in our ranks. now, now, bellatrix. let's not underestimate our young friend. by stepping forward, he lives to see another day... very well, neville. i'm sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say. nagini! with me! leave her! i said leave her! nagini die! die why do you live! it belongs to me! i killed snape! stupid girl. you cry for that? while your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons, fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it was a prayer for one and one only. while you battled courageously, until you could no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. while you cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek as a child's. so do not cry for that. he's not worthy of your tears. and do not despair of his betrayal. you were never in his heart. not for one single solitary beat. did you not hear me! harry potter is dead! from this day forward, you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. harry potter is now is the time to declare yourself. well done, draco. who will be next? hm? come now, don't be shy. i do not require assistance. i thought he would come. i was, it seems... mistaken. harry potter. the boy who lived. come to die. nagini hisses behind her protective guard of death eaters. harry's gaze shifts to her when voldemort raises nagini. come. the boy has discovered our secret, nagini. we must find out just how much he knows. we must return to our hiding places and see if the others are safe. they never learn. such a pity. begin.",1712
